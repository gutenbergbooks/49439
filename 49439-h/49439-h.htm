<h2><a name="PREFACE" id="PREFACE"></a>PREFACE</h2>
</div>

<p><i>The twenty-eight water-colour drawings reproduced
in this volume have been made from specimens of
porcelain in the collections of the Victoria and Albert
Museum, South Kensington, many of which have never
been published before, while others have not hitherto
been reproduced in colours. The selection has been
made not merely of those pieces in their several classes
which have a high sale-room value; due consideration
has been given to those which by their aesthetic qualities
appealed to the sympathies of the artist, while at the
same time an effort has been made to include objects
having some particular historical or personal interest, or
important as documents in the history of ceramics. In
this connection it should be explained that the drawings
were made before Mr. George Salting’s unrivalled collection
of Oriental porcelain passed by his death into the
hands of the nation.</i></p>

<p><i>The text does not pretend to be a general treatise
on porcelain, or even an exhaustive summary of its
history. The aim of the writer has been to record everything
that is noteworthy with regard to the several pieces<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">viii</a></span>
represented in the drawings, and at the same time to lay
stress on the particular aspects of the subject which these
examples serve to elucidate, taking them as the theme for
a discussion of various phases in the evolution of the art.</i></p>

<p><i>Anything in the nature of a bibliography of works
consulted by the author would be out of place in a publication
of this kind, but acknowledgment must be made of
his indebtedness, in the sphere of Oriental ceramics, to the
writings of Dr. Bushell, Captain Brinkley, Dr. Otto
Kümmel</i> (<i>in</i> <span xml:lang="de" lang="de">Geschichte des Kunstgewerbes</span>), <i>and Mr.
R.&nbsp;L. Hobson. For English porcelain reference has
been made, in addition to older authorities, to the works
of Mr. William Burton; while the chief authorities
consulted on the subject of Continental factories are Dr.
Brinckmann, Dr. Berling, Dr. Bertold Pfeiffer, Signor
Corona, M. le Baron Davillier, M. le Comte X. de
Chavagnac, and M. Lechevallier-Chevignard. The
author desires to express his gratefulness for various
information and personal assistance afforded him by Mr.
M. Yeats Brown, Mr. H.&nbsp;P. Mitchell, M. le Comte X.
de Chavagnac, M. Émile Auscher, and the Friherrinna
Julia Marks von Würtemberg. Thanks are also due
to Mr. J.&nbsp;H. Fitzhenry for kind permission to reproduce
a Ludwigsburg coffee-pot in his collection.</i></p>

<h2><a name="INTRODUCTORY" id="INTRODUCTORY"></a>INTRODUCTORY</h2>
</div>

<p>It is the experience probably of most Western amateurs
of porcelain to pass through three successive stages of
development in their appreciation of an art which, even
for the uninitiated,&mdash;for those who have no knowledge
of its history and little understanding of its technical
aspects,&mdash;is not lacking in charm and fascination. For,
indeed, there is about most porcelain, of whatever kind,
some quality of alluring grace, a daintiness of material,
or a pleasing play of colour, which makes an appeal at
first sight to the eye of all lovers of things beautiful.
Mere casual pleasure in its superficial attractiveness
will not fail to give place to an ever-deepening interest
for those who will take the pains to learn its inner
secrets, to discover in it, expressed in enduring form,
the creative power of a craftsman’s soul, nay more, a reflection
of the very spirit of humanity in its changing
moods, varying in conformity with racial differences or
environment of time and place. This wondrous product
of human skill,&mdash;as it were a new stone of rare
value added to those which nature has given us,&mdash;will
assuredly kindle in the hearts of its admirers a desire to
learn something of its story. They will find, in their
endeavours to understand its mysteries, that their
interest is aroused in the first place by the porcelain of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xiv" id="Page_xiv">xiv</a></span>
their own country, reflecting as it does a culture in the
midst of which they have themselves been born and
bred.</p>

<p>The English amateur will naturally seek a field for
his first studies in English porcelain. It wears a certain
air of homeliness which endears it to his heart; its
uses and forms are those which are familiar in the daily
life of his countrymen; its decoration as a rule makes
no exacting demands on his erudition in order to
be fully understood. After English porcelain, the
collector’s attention will most readily be turned to that
of the continent of Europe.</p>

<p>His apprenticeship, the first of the three stages to
which allusion has been made above, is thus spent in the
study of the Western manifestations of the art. As yet
he does not understand, and cannot appreciate at their
true value, the Eastern wares from which the European
trace their descent. In the course of his researches a
curiosity can scarcely fail to be stirred in him to know
more of these Oriental precursors. His curiosity
deepens; his desire to satisfy it brings him at last under
a new spell, and the second stage is reached. His
enthusiasm is now all for the Chinese; its perfection of
material and form, its dazzling beauty of colour, the
artistic fitness of its decoration, engage his admiration
more and more. Alien to his imagination as it is in
conception, it nevertheless fascinates him ever more
surely as he grows more familiar with it. The European
china of his early collecting days pleases him no longer.</p>

<p>But there will follow a third stage, in which a more
catholic taste is developed. The student of the Oriental
can understand much in the Western wares that was
meaningless so long as he was ignorant of the sources
from which they were derived. His appreciation of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xv" id="Page_xv">xv</a></span>
the high artistic worth of the Chinese is undiminished,
but his sympathy is now again awakened by the more
humane qualities of the European, appealing as they
do to kindred instincts in his own Western nature.
He has now reached the point at which he is able to
give its true value to all good work, whatever its origin
may be. The excellences of the Eastern do not blind
him to the merits of the Western; all alike in their
several types of beauty are a joy to his soul.</p>

<p>The very name by which porcelain is commonly known
suggests, to those in whom it arouses an interest
beyond the mere aesthetic pleasure to be got from its
outward beauty of appearance, that if they would
understand it rightly, they must turn their attention
first to the land of its origin. To the Chinese the
world owes a material as lovely as any ever fashioned
by the hand of man, and some account of the growth
of this art in Chinese hands is a necessary prelude to
any study alike of the Chinese ware itself and of the
European imitations of it.</p>

<p>The first beginnings of this wonderful art must be
sought in pottery of humble material. The rough but
dignified earthenware of the <span class="smcap">Han Dynasty</span>, contemporaneous
approximately with the opening of the
Christian era, signalises the first appearance in China of
pottery of an artistic nature. The green-glazed vessels
of this period, imitating the shapes and outward texture
of bronze, have become only in recent times familiar
objects on the shelves of our museums. From them we
can trace the porcelain of later times, by which the
Chinese have proved themselves the master-potters of
the world, excelling and giving the lead to the ceramists<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">4</a></span>
of every other race. Yet it is strange to reflect how
late in history their skill has been learned, and to
remember that Persians, Egyptians, Greeks and other
Western races were masters of the potter’s craft many
centuries before the Chinese achieved their earliest
artistic wares. Coming late into the field, they evolved
in a comparatively short span of time a material which
placed them ahead of every rival.</p>

<div class="tb">* <span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Sung Dynasty</span>, which occupied the throne of
China for more than three hundred years beginning
towards the end of the tenth century, witnessed the
first emergence of a true ceramic style. The potters of
earlier times had been content to follow the forms set
by the bronze-founder, but their successors of the Sung
period set forth on purely ceramic lines and arrived at a
great variety of wares which are recorded in Chinese
literature. To identify these among surviving specimens
that may be attributed to this period is a formidable
task for the antiquarian. The problem need not be
discussed here, as most of these wares cannot be classed
as porcelain in the ordinary sense of the word; but it is
interesting to note briefly those types which foreshadow
the developments of later times.</p>

<p>The emancipation of the potter to a position of
independence is well shown by a small vase in the
Victoria and Albert Museum of the type known as
“<i>Chün yao</i>,” made from the earliest years of the Sung
period at Chün-chou, in the province of Honan. The
vase is of ovoid form with a lizard-like dragon coiled
round it in relief; the surface is covered with a thick
lavender-blue glaze on which is a splash of strong
crimson. Though the body is porcellanous, the freedom
of the modelling marks a distinct advance from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">5</a></span>
imitative bronze vessels of earlier times, while the
brilliancy of the colouring anticipates the pure and
gorgeous hues which were among the triumphs of the
golden age of porcelain.</p>

<p>The discovery during this period of the properties of
kaolin and the effort to imitate by artificial means the
luminous beauties of jade, pointed the way to the
evolution of a white translucent porcelain body. The
cream-coloured Ting ware, made at Ting-chou in the
province of Chihli, stand, among the relics of these
far-off times which have escaped destruction, as the
first achievements in this direction. The beauty and
dignity of this ware is well exemplified by the two
quadrangular vases at South Kensington, formerly
in Dr. Bushell’s collection. The delicate floral or
diaper ornament incised under the soft ivory-toned
glaze gives promise of the skilful handiwork of the
golden age of the art. One distinctive characteristic of
porcelain, the quality of translucency, is still absent in
most wares of this order, but pieces of smaller size, such
as an exquisitely fashioned little box and cover at
Kensington, show a warm glow through their thinner
parts when held to the light.</p>

<p>Another class of ware to which reference must here
be made is the celebrated celadon ware of Lung-ch’üan,
in the province of Chekiang, which was first produced
during this dynasty in the effort to imitate green jade.
This ware was widely exported over land and sea, and
is met with in remote and unexpected corners of the
Old World. A well-known specimen of it, Archbishop
Warham’s cup, preserved at New College, Oxford, is
the first piece of Chinese ware recorded to have reached
this country. Though it has the nature rather of
fine stoneware than of porcelain, it is to be noted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">6</a></span>
as the forerunner of a large class of porcelain of later
times.</p>

<div class="tb">* <span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>It was not until the period of the <span class="smcap">Ming Dynasty</span>
that the ware usually associated in Europe with the term
“porcelain” first began to be made, that is, a ware with
a hard, pure white body, more or less translucent. The
beginning of the same period witnessed the emergence
to a position of ascendancy of the imperial factory at
Ching-tê-chên, in the province of Kiangsi. The factory
was rebuilt in 1869 by Hung Wu, the first of the Ming
emperors, and remained henceforward the chief centre
of the porcelain industry in China. The subsequent
achievements of Ching-tê-chên have never been surpassed
in the whole history of ceramic art.</p>

<p>The Ming dynasty productions have a certain well-marked
<i>cachet</i>, which distinguishes them clearly in their
several classes alike from the wares of earlier times
and from the porcelain made under the later Ch’ing
emperors. There is a notable predominance of vessels
of large size, formed of heavy material, displaying a
massiveness and bold simplicity in their contours and
decorated with designs, whether modelled or painted, of
vigorous conception and of free, even rough execution.
The potter addresses himself with energy to his task,
and is no longer limited either to the imitative work
of the Han dynasty, or to the more restrained, often
delicate performances of the intervening age. At the
same time, he has not yet gained the mastery of hand
or the familiarity with the powers of the kiln which
made possible the artistic and technical refinements
of his successors.</p>

<p>We are probably right in recognising as the earliest
productions in pure white-bodied porcelain that have
come down to us, a group, of which there are several
fine examples in the Victoria and Albert Museum;
one of these has been chosen for illustration in <a href="#PLATE_2">Plate 2</a>.
The class is characterised by a dense heavy body, massive
form, and decoration, executed by means of coloured
glazes, which are applied and fixed at a lower temperature
after the first firing of the ware. The colours are
confined to a full dark blue, turquoise-blue, straw-yellow,
and a pale manganese-violet, to which sometimes
an opaque white is added. In the greater number of
cases the outline stands out in slight relief from the
surface of the object, and is filled in with the coloured
glazes in the same manner as the hollows in the copper
base of a <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">champlevé</i> enamel. A similar technique is
met with again in the so-called <i xml:lang="es" lang="es">cuenca</i> tiles made in
Southern Spain in the sixteenth century. In some
rare instances the vase is made with double sides, and
the design is reserved in openwork by cutting through
the outer casing. This type is represented at South
Kensington by a large jar<a name="FNanchor_1" id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">1</a> decorated with a procession
of soldiers, which stands out with bold effectiveness
against the dark hollows of the pierced background.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_1" id="Footnote_1" href="#FNanchor_1" class="fnanchor">1</a> Illustrated in Dr. Bushell’s <i>Chinese Art</i>, vol. ii. fig. 12.</p></div>

<p>A fine example of the more usual method of
decoration is the piece reproduced in <a href="#PLATE_2">Plate 2</a>. It is a
jar of large dimensions which has reached this country
by way of Persia, and has been embellished there with
a mounting of brass chased with inscriptions and
medallions. The high esteem in which Chinese
porcelain has been held for centuries in the Nearer East
is evident from the pronounced Chinese influence
manifested in Persian and Syrian art from an early
period, while during the course of the Ming dynasty
the export of porcelain from China to Western Asia<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">8</a></span>
grew enormously, and the imitation of Chinese motives
became the predominant element of design in the
indigenous wares of Persia. That country was the
source which supplied a large part of the collection of
Ming porcelain now exhibited at South Kensington.</p>

<p>The jar here illustrated is of characteristically solid
material, only slightly translucent. Groups of crested
wading birds among rocks and bushes of peony in
blossom, the flower symbolical of spring in Chinese lore,
form the main feature of the decoration. On the
shoulder are lobed compartments enclosing the eight
Buddhist “Emblems of Happy Augury.” Round the
lower part are floral designs in shaped panels. The
outlines, being slightly raised from the surface of the
jar, form barriers by which the coloured glazes were
kept from mingling one with another in the kiln. The
harmonious hues serve to emphasise the bold and
simple forms of the ornament, which seem thoroughly
in keeping with the strong curves of the profile of the
vase itself.</p>

<p>Other fine examples of this class exhibiting the same
technique may be seen at South Kensington. Besides
two large jars with processions of mounted soldiers,
there are two smaller vases of the elongated pear shape
which is also characteristic of this period. One of these,
decorated with chrysanthemums and peonies, is remarkable
for the full and rich colours of the glazes, while
the other is of interest from the quaint figures on it
with their primitive garb of sewn leaves. In a pair of
square vases, probably early exponents of the style, an
effect of solemn beauty has been obtained by the use of
white and turquoise only on a manganese ground of
dense purple.</p>

<p>In the classes of porcelain which have hitherto been
dealt with, the decoration has been effected either by
cutting into the surface with a pointed instrument or
moulding it in relief, or by the addition of colouring
materials to the glaze. We must now consider the
method most widely prevalent in recent times, namely,
that of painting on the surface either before or after
glazing. In China this method came into use at a
comparatively late period. Elsewhere it had been
known for many centuries as a means of ceramic decoration.
In Persia, for example, painted designs are met
with on the pottery found by French excavators in the
lowest stratum on the site of the city of Susa, dating
possibly from 5000 years before Christ, while on the
semi-porcellanous ware of ancient Egypt painting is of
common occurrence. It was widespread as a ceramic
process in the Near East and the countries round the
Mediterranean long before it was practised by the
Chinese. The earliest painted wares of China certainly
do not date back before the Sung dynasty, and it is
doubtful whether even so great an age as this can be
ascribed to them.</p>

<p>There is a class of vases painted in a strong dark brown
with roughly-drawn ornament of Buddhistic character,
which are probably not more recent than the earliest
years of the Ming dynasty, and may date from the latter
part of the Sung period. They were made at Tzŭ-chou,
in the province of Honan. Several examples of this kind
are in the Victoria and Albert Museum, most of them
painted with spirited designs of lotus-flowers and leafy
scrollwork, sometimes with birds introduced amongst
the foliage. One vase is decorated with four shaped
panels, three enclosing lotus-flowers, while in the fourth
is a crude figure of a Buddhist monk. These vases are
worthy of special attention, as they appear to mark the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">10</a></span>
point at which a step forward was taken of far-reaching
significance in its effect on Chinese ceramics. The
introduction of the painter’s brush among the implements
of the Chinese potter led the way to developments
which placed him above his fellow-craftsmen in
other lands, amongst whom this branch of the art had
been familiar in much earlier ages.</p>

<p>Of all the materials employed as pigments in the
decoration of porcelain, the most important and the
most widespread in use is cobalt-blue. It is said that
this colour was first introduced into China from the
west of Asia as early as the tenth century, but it does
not appear to have been used for painting before the
thirteenth century. In this connection mention may be
made of a miniature vase at South Kensington of the
cream-coloured Ting ware already alluded to, which is
painted with indistinct markings in cobalt-blue. It
may be that such pieces as this can rightly be referred
back to the end of the Sung dynasty, and that we have
in them the first manifestations of the great family of
“blue and white” china, which in the eyes of the world
at large represents Chinese porcelain <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">par excellence</i>.</p>

<p>Be that as it may, it was not till the time of the
Ming emperors that there was any extensive production
of painted “blue and white” porcelain. The earliest
extant pieces that can be dated with any degree of
certainty are ascribable to the reign of the emperor
Hsüan Tê (1426&ndash;1435). There is a small bowl of this
period in the Salting Collection. It is remarkable as
well for the quality of the glaze, resembling vellum in
its texture, as for the soft greyish tones of the cobalt
used in the delicate painting of chrysanthemums and
other flowering plants.</p>

<p>Two other pieces bearing the mark of Hsüan Tê are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">11</a></span>
to be seen at South Kensington, but although they
belong undoubtedly to the Ming dynasty, it cannot be
regarded as certain that the mark upon them indicates
their actual age. One of these is a bowl painted with
a design of trees, the pine, peach, and bamboo, symbolising
long life, and the pomegranate, which is the emblem
of fecundity; by a quaint conceit the trunks of the
trees are distorted into the form of the characters <i>fu</i>
(“happiness”) and <i>shou</i> (“longevity”). The other
specimen is a tall cylindrical vase, bearing the mark in
a <i>cartouche</i> on the border, as it is sometimes found on
porcelain of the later Wan Li period. It is decorated
with conventional lotus-flowers in three horizontal bands,
painted in dark cobalt-blue and the underglaze crimson
obtained from copper, which ranks with cobalt as one of
the earliest pigments used in Chinese ceramics. A
noticeable feature of the painting is the way in which
the leaves and petals are darkened by a stippling of dots
over a lighter wash of colour.</p>

<p>Another interesting jar, of six-sided form and
undoubtedly early in date, has floral ornament executed
in dark blue, approaching to black where heavily laid
on, which recalls the designs occurring on the hexagonal
tiles from the Great Mosque at Damascus. The
Persian chased brass rim with which the jar is
mounted indicates the channel through which it has
come to the West. The Damascus tiles are believed
to date from the fifteenth century, and the resemblance
between them and the jar in question is so striking as
to suggest that they were painted under direct Chinese
influence. This view is confirmed by the occurrence
among the motives upon them of the Far Eastern
chrysanthemum.</p>

<p>Advancing to the sixteenth century and the reigns<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">12</a></span>
of Chêng Tê, Chia Ching, and Wan Li, we find surviving
“blue and white” specimens by no means rare.
To the first reign are attributed certain objects made
for Mohammedan use, as shown by the occurrence upon
them of Arabic inscriptions, and some large globular
jars with conventional lotus designs under a glaze
usually of pronounced bluish tone. The Chia Ching
period is characterised particularly by a blue of great
intensity, sometimes verging upon violet; it is seen in
several large jars at South Kensington in which the
strong painting harmonises with the massiveness of the
form.</p>

<p>The bowl figuring in <a href="#PLATE_3">Plate 3</a> shows that a more
refined style was also in vogue at the same time. It
is fashioned with the utmost delicacy and painted
in a free manner, but with unerring sureness of hand.
On the outside are seen the mythical <i>fêng huang</i>, or
phœnix, of Buddhist lore, and other smaller birds flying
amid bamboos; on the bamboo stems grows the sacred
fungus or <i>ling-chih</i>, like the bamboo itself an emblem
of longevity. In the medallion at the bottom inside
is an exquisite drawing of a song-bird perched on
the branch of a blossoming tree. The bowl is marked
underneath with the words <i>Ta Ming Chia Ching nien
chih</i> (“Made in the Chia Ching period of the great Ming
dynasty”). The soft grey-blue recalls the bowl of the
Hsüan Tê period to which reference has already been
made. Form and painting alike are executed with
spontaneity and directness, qualities as attractive as the
technical finish of later periods, when a loss of sincerity
was the inevitable price paid for exactness of workmanship.
This difference of quality may be well
appreciated by a comparison of the bowl with the “egg-shell”
plate of the Yung Chêng period reproduced in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">13</a></span>
the same drawing, to which reference will again be
made.</p>

<p>Another drawing (<a href="#PLATE_4">Plate 4</a>) shows a typical example,
formerly in Sir Charles Robinson’s collection, of the
better kind of “blue and white” produced during the
reign of Wan Li, who was contemporary with our
own Queen Elizabeth. That this elegant wine-pot
found its way to Europe at no long interval after it
was made is proved by the bronze mounting, which
happily accentuates its gracefulness of contour. The
domed cover of ogee outline and the crested borders
indicate that the mounting is of German origin, and
was done probably at Augsburg in the early years of
the seventeenth century. The six sides of the body
form panels filled in with a variety of flowers, among
which may be distinguished such oft-recurring emblems
of longevity as the lotus and the <i>ling-chih</i> or miraculous
fungus; the slender neck is painted with conventional
flames. In the hollow beneath the foot is the word <i>fu</i>
(“longevity”), written in seal character.</p>

<p>This piece belongs to the same class of finer porcelain
made under Wan Li as a melon-shaped wine-pot,
mounted in silver-gilt, bearing the London hall-mark
for 1585&ndash;86, and the well-known set of bowls, also with
Elizabethan silver-gilt mounting, which were formerly
in the possession of the Cecil family at Burghley House.
In addition to this finer porcelain, vast quantities of
“blue and white” ware of inferior quality were made
for export. It went eastwards to Japan, where it
provided patterns for some of the porcelain turned out
from the kilns of the province of Hizen, and westwards
to Persia, to be imitated in earthenware by the native
potters of the time of the great Shah Abbas II. The
decoration, rough and careless as it often is, has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">14</a></span>
generally a certain attractiveness on account of its
freedom from the fault of over-refinement. Roughly-sketched
landscapes with deer, hares or birds in shaped
panels are frequent motives.</p>

<p>A dish at South Kensington, probably of the Wan
Li period, is doubly interesting. Its decoration of
floral ornament on scrolled stems is identical with a
design not uncommon on Damascus earthenware of
the sixteenth century. The back exhibits an unglazed
surface of deep reddish-yellow, and bears, sharply cut
into the paste, the Persian word <i>naranji</i> (“orange-coloured”)
and a Persian name, probably that of a
former owner.</p>

<p>The next illustration (<a href="#PLATE_1">Plate 1</a>) stands for another
process of decoration invented in the Ming period,
which opened the way to wonderful developments in
later times. This new method consisted in painting
over the glaze in enamel colours, necessitating a second
firing at a lower temperature than that required for
fusing the glaze. The colours employed are a dry
scarlet obtained from oxide of iron, green, yellow of
straw-coloured tone, and manganese-violet, which,
together with underglaze cobalt, constitute the scheme
known as the “five colour” decoration. In some cases
only two or three of these colours are used, but
generally the predominant notes are given by red and
green. This style anticipates the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">famille verte</i> order of
the time of K’ang Hsi; it is specially associated with
the Wan Li period, when it came into general vogue,
but instances of it occur dating from the reign of Chia
Ching, and in these the red is of a more neutral tone
sometimes verging on orange.</p>

<p>The jar figuring in <a href="#PLATE_1">Plate 1</a> is altogether exceptional
by reason of the manganese-purple ground on which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">15</a></span>
the ornament is painted. The predominance of this
colour gives a splendour of effect which is accentuated
by the points of bright red and green distributed with
such sureness of judgment over the surface. The
powers of the Ming dynasty potter are here displayed
at their best. Scattered flowers of the winter plum,
one of the numerous emblems of long life, are interspersed
among the “Eight Precious Things” (<i>Pa Pao</i>),
tokens to the Buddhist of all that goes to make up
mortal felicity. Visible in the drawing are the pair of
books strung together, standing for literary accomplishments;
the open lozenge, a symbol of victory or success;
and the pearl or jewel of the law. The remaining five
objects, not appearing in the view of the vase shown in
the illustration, are the “cash,” figuring as a square
enclosed by a circle, for pecuniary wealth; the painting,
representative of the arts; the <i>ch’ing</i> or musical stone,
a kind of gong considered lucky on account of the
identity of its name with the word for “prosperity”;
the pair of rhinoceros-horn cups paralleled by the
classical “horn of plenty”; and the leaf of the artemisia,
a fragrant plant believed to be efficacious as an antidote
against harmful influences. Below these symbols are
waves of the sea, tossing in green foam against jagged
rocks; spiral eddies painted in black outline under a
wash of transparent purple form the background to
the composition. The jar was bought in Persia, and
is mounted with a brass neck and domed cover of
Persian workmanship, chased with arabesques and
pierced with grotesque figures in a row of medallions.</p>

<p>Mention has already been made of the celadon-glazed
wares made from the Sung period onwards in
imitation of green jade, which are perhaps the most
widely distributed of all the wares produced in China<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">16</a></span>
for export. To this category belong the great rice-dishes
and jars for storing grain, often of extraordinary
weight in proportion to their size, frequently met with
in India and Persia, and everywhere along the shores
and islands of the Indian Ocean. This class of porcelain
was known to the Arab traders of the Middle Ages as
“Martabani,” from the name of the Burmese port which
was one of the centres for its distribution. This
nomenclature finds its parallel in the name “Gombroon
ware,” by which it was called in England in the seventeenth
century; the establishment of the East India
Company’s factory at Gombroon on the Straits of
Ormuz first opened the way for its importation in any
considerable quantity into this country.</p>

<p>The long-necked vase of celadon ware from the
Jones Collection in <a href="#PLATE_5">Plate 5</a> may fitly be described here,
as it probably dates from the latter part of the Ming
dynasty, though the refinement of the form suggests
that it may have been made in the earlier years of
K’ang Hsi. The surface of the vase is entirely coated
with a crackled glaze of bluish-celadon tone, running
down in thick waves round the edge of the foot. On
this glaze is a design delicately traced in white slip, thick
enough to stand out in sensible relief, with details incised
by means of a pointed instrument. This decoration,
spread over the whole of the vase, is composed of archaic
dragons, from the mouths of which issue scrolled stems
with leafy terminations having in some cases the outline
of the sacred <i>ling-chih</i> fungus. The rich ormolu
mounting is characteristic French work of the period
of Louis XVI. Below the mouth of the vase hang
festoons of drapery, passing through handles which are
finished downwards with a bunch of grapes and vine-leaves;
the foot is chased with a band of guilloche
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">17</a></span>pattern above a square plinth with incurved corners.
This is probably the workmanship of Levasseur, one
of the host of artist-craftsmen to whose talent the
furniture of eighteenth-century France owes its
dignity and refinement. Their taste and judgment
was never better displayed than when objects of
beauty or rarity were handed to them to be enriched
by their skill. The vase before us is a typical case;
the porcelain loses nothing of its own loveliness in
becoming the medium for displaying the beauty of the
metalwork.</p>

<div class="tb">* <span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>The numerous minor factories existing in China
before the Ming dynasty were unable to hold their
own against the great imperial factory at Ching-tê-chên.
Since the time of its establishment there has been only
one other factory of artistic standing, that of Têhua
in the province of <span class="smcap">Fuchien</span>. It is devoted to the
production of plain white porcelain with a creamy
surface, resembling ivory in texture, but varying considerably
in shades of colour. Quantities of Fuchien
china were brought to Europe during the seventeenth
century by the various India Companies. In France,
where it received the name of “<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">blanc de Chine</i>,” it
provided models for the porcelain makers of St.
Cloud, and among the earliest output of many other
European works will be found plain white cups and teapots
with applied sprays of Chinese plum-blossom in
relief, faithfully copying the models of the Têhua
factory. Statuettes and groups of divinities always
formed a large proportion of its productions; the royal
collection at Dresden contains a fine series of such
figures, many of them nearly two feet in height, which
were among the porcelain collected by Augustus the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">18</a></span>
Strong of Saxony, through the agency of the Dutch
East India merchants.</p>

<p>The smaller objects made at Têhua are delightful
by virtue of their very simplicity. In the absence of
coloured decoration of any kind, the full charm of the
soft white surface can be appreciated. The specimen
illustrated in <a href="#PLATE_6">Plate 6</a> affords proof that this ware was
highly esteemed by early European collectors. This
piece, one of a pair in the Jones Bequest, was doubtless
originally a bottle or rosewater-sprinkler with bulbous
body and narrow tapering neck, but it has been cut
down and fitted with silver-gilt mounts to adapt it to
the purpose of a pastille-burner. The neck has been
removed and replaced by a silver-gilt knob of finely-chased
foliage. The shoulder has been drilled with
holes; lower down the porcelain has been cut away
for the insertion of a band engraved with delicate
cartouches and rosettes. The foot of the bottle is raised
on a tripod silver-gilt base, ornamented with three lions’
heads and three grotesque <i>mascarons</i> exquisitely chased.
When the piece is turned up, further enrichment is
disclosed underneath it in the form of an engraved
design of a type much in favour about 1700, representing,
in a half-grotesque manner, a squirrel, birds and a hound
among trees. The hall-marks with which the mounts
are stamped in several places are unfortunately very
indistinct, but from their form it is clear that they are
Parisian marks of the early years of the eighteenth
century. The initials of an unknown silversmith
“P.&nbsp;B.” can easily be made out, while another mark
appears to be that of Étienne Baligny, <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">fermier général</i>
from 1703 till 1713; but no marks are necessary to show
that we have here French work in the finest style of
the age of Louis XIV. The care bestowed upon the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">19</a></span>mounting is sufficient evidence of the value set upon
Fuchien porcelain by European collectors of the time.
Further testimony of this is afforded by the fact already
noticed, that the designs and methods of decoration in
vogue at the Têhua potteries were extensively imitated
in the earlier stages of several Western factories. In
the blossoming sprays of plum applied to the body of
the piece in our illustration we recognise the favourite
emblem of longevity which is of such constant occurrence
on Chinese objects, lending them a felicitous significance
appropriate to things destined to be given as presents
or tokens of congratulation. The same motive is
familiar in the early white china of Meissen, Bow, and
Chelsea, and of St. Cloud, Vincennes, and Sèvres.</p>

<p>In addition to applied reliefs the Fuchien potters
decorated their porcelain with delicate incised designs,
sometimes scarcely perceptible until closely examined,
or with ornaments impressed by means of small stamps.
An instance of the latter method is seen on the foot
of the piece under consideration, which has a repeating
border of fret-pattern lightly impressed in the paste.</p>

<div class="tb">* <span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>The reign of Wan Li was followed by an epoch
extending over nearly half a century which is almost
devoid of significance in the history of porcelain. The
invasions of the Manchu Tartars brought to an end the
native Ming dynasty, and gave its last two emperors
little leisure for the patronage of art. The establishment
on the throne of the still-ruling Ch’ing dynasty of Tartar
emperors was the opening of a new era, and the
accession of its second monarch, <span class="smcap">K’ang Hsi</span>, was the
signal for a brilliant artistic renaissance, nowhere more
apparent in its effects than in the wonderful achievements
of the imperial porcelain works at Ching-tê-chên.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">20</a></span>
K’ang Hsi’s reign of sixty years’ duration covered
roughly the same space of time as that of his illustrious
French contemporary, the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Grand Monarque</i>, who gave
the impetus for a similar revival in the arts of his own
kingdom. It was an age of peace and order following
after years of strife and confusion. Energies no longer
required to be spent in warfare were free to be diverted
to the pursuance of the arts of peace.</p>

<p>In the domain of porcelain the outcome of these
favourable conditions is seen in an extraordinary
advance along technical lines unparalleled in the
history of ceramics. A white body of the utmost
purity, a glaze fusing so perfectly on to the surface of
the paste as to give an appearance of deep luminosity,
underglaze colours and overglaze enamels unsurpassed
in brilliance and liveliness, brought within the reach of
the potter a wonderful variety of effects far beyond
anything that had been attained before. Yet the very
technical skill which made the triumphs of the K’ang
Hsi period possible, opened the way for the artistic
decline of the following half century. Virtuosity took
the place of aesthetic spontaneity; while there is undeniable
beauty in the new achievements, they generally
lack the vigour and sincerity of earlier periods when the
principles of technique were less well understood.</p>

<p>The characteristic qualities of K’ang Hsi porcelain
are well illustrated by the vases chosen for the drawings
reproduced in Plates 7 and 8. The first of these is
a “blue and white” covered vase, formerly in the
collection of Mr. James Orrock, with decoration in
shaped panels reserved on a “powdered blue” ground.
Of the four large panels, two are filled with sprays
of flowers, and a third with a selection from the
curious assemblage of objects known as the “Hundred<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">21</a></span>
Antiques” (<i>Po Ku</i>), symbolising the elegant arts
and accomplishments. In the remaining panel is a
mountainous landscape rendered in the conventional
manner customary in Chinese paintings; the conventions
are not such as we are familiar with in Western
art, but once accepted, they will be found to suggest
nature and to perform a decorative function no less
effectively than those of the European designer.</p>

<p>The cobalt-blue is typical of the finest quality of the
period; it has a depth of tone and a limpid brilliancy
found only in the reign of K’ang Hsi, compared with
which all but the best blue of other periods seems dingy
and lustreless. The ground colour is carefully sprayed
or splashed on to the vase, and has in consequence on
a close inspection a minutely speckled appearance; to
this is owing the intense throbbing effect which has
often been noticed as the peculiar quality of the blue
of this class. This beauty of colour, combined with
the faultless spacing of the decoration, compensates for
a certain prim formality noticeable when comparison is
made with the less orderly designs of the Ming dynasty.</p>

<p>Passing on to <a href="#PLATE_8">Plate 8</a>, we come to a representative
of the class of decoration above all others associated with
the K’ang Hsi period. This class is derived from the
“five colour” group, already discussed, of the later
Ming emperors, characterised by painting in enamel
colours fired over the glaze at a comparatively low
temperature, and hence known to French collectors
as enamels of the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">demi-grand feu</i>. From the predominance
of green the class is generally termed the
“<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">famille verte</i>.” The blue comprised among the five
colours of the Ming dynasty is always an underglaze
cobalt painted on the biscuit before the application of
the glaze; but in the majority of pieces of later date,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">22</a></span>
whether strictly of the “five colour” order or of the
derivative <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">famille verte</i>, the blue, like the rest of the
pigments, is an overglaze enamel.</p>

<p>The vase here illustrated is of special interest as
exemplifying the use of both kinds of blue; while in
the main decoration an enamel blue of greyish tone has
been employed, there are also two bands, round the
shoulder and base respectively, filled with a diaper
pattern in underglaze blue enclosed between ridges
in slight relief. The form of the vase is that known
as “club-shaped.” The scheme of decoration is of a
type which became increasingly prevalent as the
eighteenth century advanced, and departs entirely
from the traditions of earlier times. Instead of a
broadly-treated design proportionate to the dimensions
of the vase, the surface is divided into a number of
panels of diverse size and outline, set against a figured
groundwork and filled in with delicate miniature paintings.
Two large rectangular panels contain rocky
lake-scenes with figures. Smaller panels enclose some
of the “Hundred Antiques” already alluded to, while
in two circular medallions we see a carp rising from a
cataract, beneath a full moon partly hidden among
clouds. This latter subject is an allegory of literary
success attained by perseverance and industry. The
allusion is to the legend according to which the sturgeon
of the Hoang Ho river, when they ascend the stream in
the third month of the year, are transformed into
dragons if they succeed in climbing the rapids of the
Lung Mên or Dragon Gate. The green ground of the
vase is figured with a close pattern of conventional
lotus-flowers amid small scrolled foliage. The whole is
exquisitely rendered, and composes such a beautiful
harmony of colour as to compel admiration, in spite of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">23</a></span>the comparative lack of breadth in the treatment of
the design.</p>

<p>To detail all the methods of decoration in vogue in
the K’ang Hsi period, many of them then for the first
time introduced, would be beyond the scope of such a
work as this; it must suffice to mention briefly a few
of the most remarkable. Firstly, there are many
varieties of the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">famille verte</i>, the most notable being
that in which naturalistic flowers are relieved against
a ground of enamel, either straw-yellow, green, or
lustrous black. The pieces on which the last-named
ground colour occurs form the subdivision known to
connoisseurs as the “<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">famille noire</i>”; the Salting Collection
includes a splendid series of vases of this category.
Dignity of form is combined in them with masterly
composition in the painting, while the measure of conventionalism
necessitated by the limited palette frees
this type from the imputation of excessive naturalism.</p>

<p>The “blue and white” of the time of K’ang Hsi
has already been noticed. Beautiful effects were obtained
where the cobalt was used in harmonious combination
with the other high temperature underglaze
pigments, a greyish celadon-green and the soft crimson
obtained from copper. Another new type of painted
ware dating from this time is that in which the design
is entirely carried out in the overglaze iron-red, first
seen amongst the pigments of the “five colour” order.
The red of the K’ang Hsi period, a pure coral-red of
the utmost brilliancy, is generally employed in conventional
designs, such as dragons and symbols or
lotus-flowers, symmetrically disposed over the whole
surface of a vase.</p>

<p>Perhaps the greatest glory of the reign are the
single-colour and variegated glazes, reviving and excelling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">24</a></span>
the achievements in this direction of the Sung
dynasty. Chief among these are the crimson, or “<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">sang
de bœuf</i>,” and the apple-green associated with the name
of Lang T’ing-tso, viceroy during the beginning of the
reign of the province of Kiangsi, in which the imperial
kilns of Ching-tê-chên are situated; further developments
were attained, such as the “peach-bloom,” the
“kingfisher” turquoise-blue, and the revived “<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">clair de
lune</i>,” when in 1683 Ts’ang Ying-hsüan was appointed
director of the factories. These wares rank among
the most splendid achievements of the potter’s art; in
beauty of form and gorgeousness of colour they have
never been surpassed, while by their nature they are
free from the defect of over-refinement incident to
the productions of an age of great technical discoveries,
which has been noticed in speaking of the painted
porcelain.</p>

<p>Lastly, before passing on to the next reign, a word
must be said of the statuettes of divinities and the
objects fashioned in the shape of fruit or living creatures,
which are another feature of the K’ang Hsi renaissance.
Painted generally in the enamel colours of the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">famille
verte</i>, these figures are often masterpieces of modelling,
instinct with vivacity and expression.</p>

<div class="tb">* <span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>The short reign of <span class="smcap">Yung Chêng</span>, who succeeded
K’ang Hsi in 1723, witnessed still further advances in
the direction of technical perfection, accompanied on
the artistic side by a corresponding growth of the
tendency to over-refinement. The discovery during
the latter years of K’ang Hsi of a rose-coloured
enamel derived from gold, varying in shade from
pink to crimson, opened the way for a revolution in
the colour-scheme which is the chief characteristic
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">25</a></span>of the painted porcelain of Yung Chêng and his
successor Ch’ien Lung. From the prevalence of
this colour, the type of porcelain on which it occurs
received the name of “<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">famille rose</i>” among French
connoisseurs. The widened range of the enamel-painter’s
palette made possible a completely naturalistic
manner, in which all conventionalism of treatment
was abandoned. No album of flora can show more
faithful botanical drawings than are to be seen in such
exquisite subjects after nature as that in the piece reproduced
in <a href="#PLATE_2">Plate 2</a>; in no work on ornithology could be
found truer renderings of bird life. The plate, painted
with a bird of the kingfisher family perched on the
branch of a gnarled plum-tree in flower, belongs to
the collection bequeathed by Mr. W.&nbsp;H. Cope. The
spray of blossoming pomegranate which completes
the composition is naturally rendered by means of
the newly-invented carmine enamel. While we may
question the fitness of a subject thus treated for the
decoration of a porcelain plate, we cannot but admire
the exquisite delicacy of the painting and the skilful
arrangement of the composition.</p>

<p>Perhaps the most famous of the productions of the
Yung Chêng period are the plates and cups and saucers
of thin “egg-shell” china with enamel decoration of
figure-subjects or birds and flowers enclosed within
elaborate borders of complex diaper. The same fine
porcelain was employed as a material for lanterns; fine
examples of these are exhibited in the Victoria and
Albert Museum.</p>

<p>Concurrently with such technical refinements as
these, there came about under Yung Chêng an archaistic
revival of ancient wares, resulting from the commission
given by the emperor for the reproduction of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">26</a></span>
ceramic treasures of past centuries preserved in his
palaces. Imitations were made both of the shapes and
of the numerous varieties of glaze of the factories of the
Sung dynasty, while in the “blue and white” category
the spotted manner of painting already noticed as
characteristic of the reign of Hsüan Tê was specially
in favour. Another ancient type extensively reproduced
was the “five colour” class of the later Ming
emperors. Where there cannot be traced a refinement
in the handling of the design foreign to the earlier
painters, the copies are readily distinguished from
their prototypes by a difference in the quality of the
colours employed. The underglaze cobalt-blue has a
decidedly violet <i>nuance</i>, a delicate lilac replaces the
earlier purple, and the green is of a lighter grass-coloured
hue; furthermore, the enamel colours often display a
faint iridescence where the light glances on them.
The vase represented in <a href="#PLATE_9">Plate 9</a> is a fine example of
this archaistic school of the time of Yung Chêng. The
shape, of noble simplicity, dates back to the earliest
period of the Ming dynasty, but the decoration belongs
to the “five colour” type of Wan Li. The design is
composed of a dragon and a mythical phœnix (<i>fêng
huang</i>), emblems of the emperor, amid flowers and
foliage of the tree-peony on wavy stems. The breadth
of treatment, the vigorous drawing, the masterly balance
of the colouring, entitle this vase to a place among the
best performances of the Chinese potter.</p>

<p>By the time of the Emperor <span class="smcap">Ch’ien Lung</span>, whose
reign of sixty years ended in 1795, deteriorating
influences made themselves felt with ever-increasing
insistence, and the story of Chinese porcelain from this
time forward is a record of steady decline. The seeds
of decay may be considered to have been planted about<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">27</a></span>
the beginning of the seventeenth century, when the
establishment of the European trading companies
brought China into close and constant touch with the
Western world. The new markets thus opened for
Chinese products inevitably brought about the creation
of a new style in Chinese art to suit the taste of
European buyers. Traces of Western influence may
be discerned, if not in the decoration, at all events in
the forms of Chinese porcelain all through the seventeenth
century, and in K’ang Hsi’s reign its effect is
fully apparent. The splendid rebirth of art and culture
consequent upon the restoration of peace in the empire
under his rule availed for a time to check the sinister
effect of these changes; but as the eighteenth century
advanced, a new class of wares affecting shapes unknown
to Oriental customs and designed to meet Western
requirements, was produced in ever-increasing quantities,
and did not fail to influence the whole output of the
Chinese kilns. The commercial spirit thus engendered,
hastened the decline already originated by too close
attention to the technical side of ceramic craftsmanship.
The result is seen in the shapeless extravagances,
wonderful in technique, but devoid of grace and beauty,
produced in the latter years of Ch’ien Lung, and in the
dreary “India china” made for export through the
various India companies of Europe. There was a
momentary gleam of revival in the nineteenth century
under Taou Kuang, when creditable copies were made
of some of the Yung Chêng designs, but such imitative
efforts do not avail to arouse the interest of those to
whom the art of a country ceases to appeal, when it
reflects the genius of a people no longer in the full
vigour of manhood.</p>

<span class="subhead">JAPANESE PORCELAIN</span></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">31</a></span>
The subject of Japanese porcelain can only be briefly
discussed here, on the one hand in its relation to the
Chinese porcelain of which it may be considered an
offshoot, and on the other, from the point of view of
its influence on European factories. Though the origin
of the art in Japan is obscure, it is certain that the
Japanese learned the making of porcelain from their
neighbours across the sea. Tradition asserts that one
Gorodayiu Go Shonsui visited the Chinese factories in
1510 with this purpose, and on his return established a
kiln of short-lived duration for the manufacture in his
own country. It is not, however, until the beginning
of the following century that sure ground is reached;
about that time the necessary materials were discovered
in the province of Hizen, in the extreme south-west of
the island empire, by a Corean potter named Risanpei,
and porcelain kilns were set up by him at <span class="smcap">Arita</span>, which
remains to the present day one of the chief Japanese
centres of the industry.</p>

<p>At first only blue and white wares were made, but
about 1645 the method of painting in enamel colours
over the glaze was learned from a Chinaman by a
potter of the Arita factory named Kakiyemon, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">32</a></span>
the style of decoration associated with him was inaugurated.
This style was maintained by more than
one generation of the Kakiyemon family, and characterises
a quantity of the porcelain exported to
Europe through the Dutch merchants established at
Deshima, in the outskirts of Nagasaki. As will be seen
later, it provided patterns for imitation in many of the
earlier European porcelain works; most of the pieces
so imitated, as, for instance, the prototype of the
Chelsea jar figuring in <a href="#PLATE_23">Plate 23</a>, bear designs of a
formal character, showing that they probably do not
belong to the earliest work of the Kakiyemon school.
A typical example of this later manner is a large jar at
South Kensington, painted with a group of figures and
trees repeated in three panels, reserved on a close
pattern of peony-flowers and foliage; a dish in the
Brighton Museum, bearing on the back the name “<i>Kaki</i>”
in seal characters, shows formal designs painted with
extraordinary neatness with a full palette of enamel
colours, betokening a still later stage in the development
of the style. Charming as these more familiar
designs are by reason of their clean drawing and the
purity of their colours, they must be regarded as somewhat
foreign to the Japanese genius, being the outcome
of the effort to please the taste of Western buyers. The
purely Japanese manner which may be attributed to
the first Kakiyemon is illustrated by some small plates
at Kensington from the Bowes Collection; the design
is limited to slight floral sprays or a few detached
blossoms in three colours only, red, green, and light
blue, so as to allow the qualities of the soft white glaze
to be fully appreciated.</p>

<p>The baneful influence of contact with the West,
already noticed in dealing with Chinese porcelain, did not
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">33</a></span>fail to make itself felt in the work of the Arita potters.
From the last quarter of the seventeenth century
may be dated the appearance of the ware generally
considered in Europe as peculiarly characteristic of
Japanese ceramics, but in reality of a type entirely
alien from native ideas. Though made at Arita, it is
usually called by the name of the neighbouring port of
Imari, from which it was exported. The style is embodied
in jars and dishes generally of large dimensions,
decorated in underglaze blue of muddy tone, with dull
red, green, purple and yellow enamels and gilding added
at a subsequent firing over the glaze. Their effect is
occasionally pleasing and handsome, but in general
these objects have a dull and lifeless air that places
them among the least interesting of all Oriental wares.
This style was sometimes copied both at Meissen and
at Chelsea during their earlier stages, and suggested
some of the designs of the Worcester factory, but it
was not till the first decades of the nineteenth century
that it was extensively imitated, when the “Japan
patterns” of Derby and the Staffordshire works enjoyed
a great popularity; it may fairly be said that in the
reduced scale necessitated by their application to table
wares, and in the livelier colouring obtainable in the
English soft porcelain, these patterns gain an attractiveness
wanting in their Oriental forerunners.</p>

<div class="tb">* <span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>Other kilns were founded in the neighbourhood of
Arita under the protection of feudal lords, by whose
patronage they were secured from the debasing effects
of foreign trade. Porcelain began to be made about
1660 at the kilns of <span class="smcap">Okawaji</span>, founded at an earlier date
for making earthenware by a chief of the Nabeshima
family. Here the methods of painting employed were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">34</a></span>
those of the later Arita potters, but the colours are
purer and the decoration, designed to please native
tastes, is at once less florid and more spontaneous in
character.</p>

<p>Fine porcelain was made in the second half of the
eighteenth century at <span class="smcap">Mikawaji</span>, also in the province
of Hizen, under the munificent patronage of the feudal
lord of Hirato. The wares are of two principal types.
The first is painted in blue of a quiet grey tone with
designs of exquisite delicacy, inspired by the Chinese
“blue and white” of the time of Hsüan Tê; and it
should be noted that this milder quality of blue was
deliberately aimed at by the potters of the best Japanese
schools, in preference to the deep sapphire blue attained
by the Chinese at their highest period of development.
The second class of Mikawaji ware is seen in the skilfully
modelled figures of divinities, children, or mythical
creatures such as the Corean lion; they are usually
enlivened with coloured glazes of three harmonious tones,
blue, russet-brown, and black.</p>

<div class="tb">* <span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>Two other Japanese factories remain to be noticed
in their relation to Chinese ceramics, in the provinces of
Kaga and Kishiu respectively. The kilns at <span class="smcap">Kutani</span>
in Kaga were established in 1664 and made two distinct
classes of ware. One of these is called “<i>Ao Kutani</i>,”
or green Kutani, from the predominance of green in the
colouring, and is characterised by the use of transparent
green, yellow, manganese-violet, and blue enamels of
great intensity, washed over strong floral or landscape
designs drawn in heavy black outline. This type is
perfectly exemplified by a fine dish in the series at
South Kensington brought together by the Japanese
Government in 1876. While it appears to be reminiscent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">35</a></span>
in its methods of the “three colour” class of the
Chinese, its artistic character is free from extraneous
elements and entirely Japanese in genius. The other
type, known <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">par excellence</i> as “<i>Ko Kutani</i>,” or old
Kutani ware, includes a brilliant red among its colours,
and is the ancestor of the red and gold Kaga porcelain
of recent times.</p>

<p>The porcelain made in the Nishihama park, near
Wakayama in the province of <span class="smcap">Kishiu</span>, dates only from
the earlier years of the nineteenth century, but is of
interest as a revival of the early Ming ware with designs
in coloured glazes separated by outlines moulded in
slight relief; the enamels of the Kishiu kilns produce a
wonderful richness of effect, notably where turquoise
blue is used in combination with deep violet.</p>

<p>The manufacture of porcelain in Europe has a history
of very recent origin when compared with the long
story of its invention and development in the land of
its birth, but what it lacks in antiquity is atoned for
by the interest and diversity of the vicissitudes through
which it has passed. We can never know at what
period and by whose agency the mysterious substance
was first brought into Western lands. From the earliest
records that can rightly be supposed to refer to it, we
gather that the rare vessels of porcelain which found
their way from China in the Middle Ages were regarded
with superstitious wonder as the work of superhuman
hands, to be treasured as jealously as gold or precious
stones. How to rival this ware of pure white surface
and translucent substance may well have been the
problem that many a potter of those days attempted to
solve, but it must have been the despair of the rudely-trained
craftsmen whose hands shaped the rough stone-wares
of the Rhineland, or the lead-glazed slip-wares,
with their artless scratched or moulded designs, of
mediæval France and Italy. The road to success was
first opened by the potters of the last-named country.
The Italian tin-enamelled maiolica, which attained its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">40</a></span>
full development at the end of the fifteenth century,
marks the first pronounced step in the advance. It
derived its inspiration in the first instance not
immediately from Chinese porcelain, but indirectly
through the painted earthenware of the Near East and
of the Moors in Spain, which was itself evolved in
emulation of the Chinese wares. By the early years
of the sixteenth century, the latter must have been
quite familiar to the Italian maiolica potters, who used
the term “<i xml:lang="it" lang="it">alla porcellana</i>” to denote a certain type of
design in which they sought to imitate the contemporary
Oriental “blue and white.”</p>

<p>The mere outward simulation that could be achieved
by coating grey earthenware with pure white enamel
did not satisfy the keen spirits of an age when every
mind was pregnant with new ideas, and no task seemed
too gigantic for the artist’s hand. To produce a body
which, in substance and surface as well, should equal
the object of imitation, must have been the aim of
many a pioneer in the art of whose efforts all record has
been lost.</p>

<p>If contemporary documents are to be trusted, it
would appear that something in the nature of porcelain
was made in Italy as early as the first quarter of the
sixteenth century; it is not surprising to learn that the
scene of the first successful experiments was Venice, a
city by that time famous all over Europe for its glass,
a substance for the manufacture of which its seaboard
situation gave it exceptional advantages. Though the
literary evidences for the fabrication are too clear to
be reasonably doubted, no piece of this early Venetian
porcelain is known to exist at the present day. We reach
sure ground towards the end of the century, when we
come to the porcelain invented at <span class="smcap">Florence</span> about
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">41</a></span>1575 by Francesco de’ Medici, the second Grand Duke
of Tuscany. This, the earliest European porcelain of
which specimens still survive, is an imperfect artificial
porcelain largely compounded of glass. It is mentioned
in a letter dated 1576 by the Venetian ambassador at
the Tuscan Court. The only dated specimen known
is a flask with the arms of Philip II. of Spain and the
date 1581, now in the museum at Sèvres. The Grand
Duke probably ceased after a short time to take interest
in the factory, and it became a private enterprise; of
its subsequent fortunes something will be said on a
later page.</p>

<p>While as regards material the object of emulation
was Chinese porcelain, the forms affected by the Medici
porcelain show little indication of extraneous influence.
By their variety and by the gracefulness of many they
bear witness to the taste and inventiveness of the
ducal patron, who interested himself personally in the
processes of fabrication and was doubtless in artistic
matters the guiding spirit of the works. The decoration,
painted in cobalt-blue usually of rather dull tone, either
alone or outlined with pale manganese-violet, is of two
distinct styles. One of these is made up of grotesques
of the kind familiar in the later maiolica of the Urbino
school. The other style is marked by Oriental motives,
derived in some cases from Chinese, but more often
from Near Eastern sources. The designs are never
mere copies, but rather interpretations of their prototypes;
often indeed they betray only slight traces of
the inspiration to which they are due.</p>

<p>The last-named class of design is well exemplified
by the bottle in <a href="#PLATE_10">Plate 10</a>, one of the four pieces of
Medici porcelain belonging to the Victoria and Albert
Museum. The subtle shapeliness of the modelling and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">42</a></span>
the ably-distributed painted ornament, in which a slight
suggestion of the contemporary Chinese “blue and white”
of Wan Li is perceptible, betoken the work of an artist
whose conceptions were superior to the material at his
disposal for their embodiment.</p>

<div class="tb">* <span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>From the scanty documents that remain, it would
appear that the venture of Francesco de’ Medici was
abandoned for a time, and that his successor Ferdinand
I. summoned to Florence one Niccolò Sisti for the
purpose of re-establishing there the manufacture of
porcelain. The kilns were later removed to <span class="smcap">Pisa</span>, and
a document exists to prove that in 1620 Sisti received
monetary aid for his work from the then-reigning Grand
Duke, Cosmo II. In the light of these records, meagre
as they are, the greatest interest attaches to the little
bowl figuring in <a href="#PLATE_11">Plate 11</a>, one of the most precious
documentary pieces of porcelain in the South Kensington
collections; it was formerly in the possession of Mr.
Henry Griffith and later belonged to Mr. Henry Willett
of Brighton, on whose death it was acquired for the
Museum. This bowl is of remarkably thin material,
light to handle, and shows a somewhat yellow tone in
the paste by transmitted light. The design painted
round the outside consists of four alternate sprays of
hyacinth and lily, separated by flowers resembling
scabious or cornflower branching from a curved serrated
leaf; these motives are obviously borrowed from the
Turkish earthenware of the period. In a medallion
inside the bowl is a view of a city with a domed building;
on the bottom are the initials “G.&nbsp;G.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;F.” and the
date 1638.</p>

<p>The only other piece hitherto identified as belonging
to the same kind is another bowl, in the collection of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">43</a></span>
Mr. Montague Yeats Brown. Like its companion, it
is light in weight and thin in the walls. It is decorated
round the sides externally and internally with a frieze
of birds perched upon rocks; inside is a medallion with
a group of ruins among trees, curiously anticipating the
fanciful compositions seen on Worcester and Bow china
of the eighteenth century. In the painting there appear
in addition to cobalt-blue two colours of common
occurrence in the maiolica of the Urbino school, a strong
brownish-orange and a greenish-blue derived from
copper, the latter much blurred in the firing. This
bowl also bears a signature and date, “I.&nbsp;G.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;F. 1627”,
and it is of extreme interest to observe that both bowls
are marked with the same devices, a cross potent and a
curious aggregation of strokes, of which the significance
is difficult to determine; evidently these signs are the
distinctive mark of the factory. The meaning of the
initials is also uncertain, but in view of the known
existence of the Sisti factory at Pisa a few years before
the date on the earlier bowl, it may be conjectured that
the last letters “P.&nbsp;F.”, occurring in both signatures
alike, stand for “<i xml:lang="it" lang="it">Pisanus fecit</i>” or “<i xml:lang="it" lang="it">Pisano fece</i>”; if
that be so, the preceding “G” may indicate the family
name of the potters who took over from Sisti the secret
of porcelain making, while the “I” and the first “G”
respectively refer to the baptismal names of different
members of the family. Be this as it may, these two
bowls, unique in the nature of their paste and decoration
and by reason of the dates they bear, are of the utmost
interest as isolated landmarks in the history of European
porcelain, standing midway between the production of
Francesco de’ Medici and the earliest French achievements.</p>

<div class="tb">* <span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>The Tuscan experiments above recorded were made
at an unpropitious time, and were consequently destined
to have no lasting effect in the development of European
ceramics. Italy was then fast relapsing into the state
of torpor which followed as a reaction from her restless
activities in the age of the renaissance, and the time had
not yet arrived when the influx of Chinese porcelain,
resulting from the extension of trade relations with the
East, was to spur on the potters and chemists of Europe,
aided by royal patronage, to success in their efforts to
produce a similar kind of ware. Porcelain is not heard
of again in Italy till about 1720, when Francesco
Vezzi, a Venetian goldsmith, in co-operation with a
deserter from the Saxon royal factory, succeeded for
a short time in producing hard porcelain of a type
similar to that of Meissen. At a later date another
Saxon workman named Hewelcke set up a short-lived
factory in <span class="smcap">Venice</span>, but no porcelain of importance was
produced there till the establishment of the works of
Geminiano Cozzi in 1765.</p>

<p>The chief Italian factory was that at <span class="smcap">Doccia</span> near
Florence, founded by the Marchese Carlo Ginori in
1735 and still kept up by his descendants. His aim
was to compete with the porcelain imported from
Saxony, and he succeeded in his efforts without the
princely support by which alone in most European
countries the manufacture was saved from failure.
He obtained the assistance of an expert from the
factory at Vienna, Carl Wendelin Anreiter, of whose
painted work on porcelain rare specimens are occasionally
met with. The earliest Doccia productions showed
distinct signs of Meissen influence, as may be seen from
a soup-bowl in the Victoria and Albert Museum; this
has a basket-work rim of the Meissen type, and is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">45</a></span>
decorated with genre scenes from Italian peasant life in
medallions, surrounded by tendrils in red and gold and
small panels of lilac colour. Other pieces of the same
service bear the mark of a Doccia painter, Pietro
Fanciullacci. At a later stage the Ginori works became
famous for their large reproductions in white porcelain
of antique statues in the Florentine palaces, such as
the Crouching Venus and the Apollo Belvedere.</p>

<div class="tb">* <span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>The celebrated royal factory at <span class="smcap">Capodimonte</span>, near
Naples, is said to owe its origin to a present of Meissen
porcelain made to Charles III., King of the Two
Sicilies, in 1736, when he married the Saxon princess
Maria Amelia. Its earliest productions were in white
porcelain moulded with shells, coral, and other marine
decorations, but its fame is more specially founded on
the services with mythological subjects minutely picked
out in enamel colours. As at Doccia, the inborn genius
of the Italians for modelling was exhibited in figures and
elaborate statuettes, in which drapery and flesh are
usually tinted after nature. A characteristic example
is a large allegorical composition at Kensington,
supported on four figures copied from the crouching
Turkish slaves (“<i xml:lang="it" lang="it">I quattro Mori</i>”) by Pietro Tacca, which
surround the monument of Ferdinand I. of Tuscany in
the harbour at Leghorn; modelling and colouring alike
display the tendency to exaggeration and sensationalism
characteristic of Italian art in the period of decadence.
When Charles III. succeeded in 1759 to the throne
of Spain, he removed with him to the palace of <span class="smcap">Buen
Retiro</span>, near Madrid, the whole establishment of his
Neapolitan factory; the Madrid porcelain is of a
similar kind to that made before the transfer of the
works.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">46</a></span>
The later factory carried on at <span class="smcap">Naples</span> under
Ferdinand IV. shows the influence of the excavations
at Herculaneum in the severe classical style by which
it is marked. Painted views of the district of Naples
and of the local antiquities are a favourite feature. At
the same time the works gained some renown by the
cleverly modelled statuettes in biscuit china of greyish
tone made under the direction of Filippo Tagliolini.</p>

The Florentine experiments and the Pisa bowls remain
as solitary relics in the story of European porcelain
until the year 1673, when the scene is shifted to France.
At this date a privilege was granted for making
porcelain to Edme Poterat, of St. Sever, a suburb of
Rouen, in the name of his son Louis. Since 1644 he
had been working as a <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">faïencier</i> as lessee of the Sieur
Poirel de Grandval, <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">huissier de cabinet</i> to Anne of
Austria; the Sieur Poirel had been granted an exclusive
licence for making faïence in the province of Normandy.
The manufacture of porcelain at Rouen was not
continued for long after the death of Poterat in 1694,
in consequence of a dispute between his sons, which
resulted in their privilege being withdrawn. The
nature of this earliest French porcelain is established by
a few pieces, which there are sufficient grounds for
supposing to be authentic. One of these is at South
Kensington, a tall cup finely fashioned in a paste of
bluish tone and carefully painted in a strong underglaze
blue; the design consists of small vases of flowers amid
formal <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">lambrequin</i> ornament below a castellated border.</p>

<p>A point of special interest in connection with the
earliest French experiments is that, while the efforts of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">50</a></span>
their authors were consciously directed at the emulation
of Oriental porcelain, the style of decoration adopted
by them was thoroughly French, showing hardly any
trace of Chinese influence. The surviving Rouen
specimens are closely similar in their ornament to the
faïence produced by the factory in which they were
made. The same is true of the porcelain manufactured,
for the first time in Europe on a commercial scale, at
<span class="smcap">St. Cloud</span>, near Paris. This factory was started by a
Rouen potter named Pierre Chicaneau for the making
of earthenware. As the result of experiments made
shortly before his death, Chicaneau could boast of
producing objects in porcelain “<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">presqu’aussi parfait que
les porcelaines de la Chine et des Indes</i>.” His widow and
family continued the work he had begun, and in 1702
were granted letters patent by Louis XIV.; the factory
was subsequently carried on by Henri Trou, second
husband of Chicaneau’s widow. The jar reproduced in
<a href="#PLATE_12">Plate 12</a> illustrates admirably the style in vogue at the
St. Cloud works. Formal devices adapted from Rouen
faïence and inspired by the designs of Bérain, are
symmetrically disposed as borders, leaving a large part
of the surface free, so as to display to full advantage
the soft tone of the glaze. The sense of fitness and
proportion never absent from the best French work
asserts itself as much in the painted ornament as in the
rich ormolu mount with which the jar is embellished.
The legs of console outline and the rayed masks
between them are typical forms of the art of Louis
XIV.’s reign; instinct as they are with sober dignity,
they are saved from stiffness of effect by the contrast
of the band of running foliage engraved on the collar
round the top of the jar.</p>

<p>Painting in blue under the glaze was the predominant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">51</a></span>
manner of decoration at St. Cloud. In other cases the
porcelain is left white, and only moulded ornaments are
used; these are either copied directly from the Chinese
Fuchien porcelain,&mdash;here at last Oriental motives
appear,&mdash;or they exhibit a hybrid mingling of classical
and Chinese forms. The latter type is seen in a fine
soup-tureen in the Fitzhenry gift at South Kensington;
it is moulded with pseudo-Oriental cranes and foliage in
relief above a gadrooned border, and has grotesque mask
handles and a knob in the form of a cabbage. The
tureen is of special interest because to the relief decoration
has been added enamel colouring in primrose-yellow,
green, and pale red; an examination of the piece discloses
on the bottom, not only the incised mark of Henri Trou,
but also a <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">fleur-de-lys</i> in overglaze blue, showing that
the colouring was added at the Spanish royal factory of
Buen Retiro. Another tureen in the same collection
has polychrome painting executed at St. Cloud, a
typical example of a rare class; in a strong orange-yellow,
green, purple, red and blue are depicted Oriental
figures and a motive of a bird singing among trees by a
wattled hedge, borrowed from the Japanese Kakiyemon.</p>

<div class="tb">* <span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>The life of the St. Cloud works was a long one,&mdash;it
lasted till 1766, having survived a disastrous fire in
1737,&mdash;and its output must have been considerable;
yet it had little direct influence on the subsequent
history of ceramics. It is indeed interesting to note
here the existence at Kensington of a <i>seau</i> in Staffordshire
salt-glazed stoneware with relief ornament copied
from a St. Cloud model; but this is an isolated case, and
imitations of St. Cloud are not common even among the
productions of French factories. A different tale can
be told of the next in importance of the early French<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">52</a></span>
china works. The factory founded in 1725 by Louis-Henri
de Bourbon, prince de Condé, on his domain at
<span class="smcap">Chantilly</span>, was destined to hold a position of more
than transient significance. Not only were styles of
decoration devised there which became popular beyond
the Channel as well as in France itself; Chantilly has a
greater claim to recognition in that it was two Chantilly
workmen who initiated the greatest of all European
enterprises of this kind, the royal and national manufactory
at Sèvres.</p>

<p>Before entering into details of this passage in the
course of events, some account must be given of the
productions of the parent factory. The prince de
Condé chose for his director one Ciquaire Cirou, who
appears to have been a faïence-maker, and obtained
royal recognition by a grant of letters patent in 1735.
The distinguishing element in the earlier Chantilly
porcelain is the use as a surface-coating of the same
tin-enamel which is the generic feature of faïence.
For some ten years the Chantilly potters confined their
artistic efforts as far as painting was concerned to
adaptations or often close imitations of Oriental
porcelain of the preceding decades, of which the
princely patron had a rich collection. The Chinese
<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">famille verte</i> supplied the motives in a few instances,
but the wares which suggested to Cirou and his
painters their daintiest designs were the work of Kakiyemon.
Few things have been made to display more
effectively the delicate freshness which is the crowning
virtue of painted porcelain. The warm tone of the
stanniferous glaze yields a softer ground for the flower-like
hues of the enamel colours than the colder white of
the Japanese prototypes, while the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">esprit</i> of the French
interpreter adds to the charming Eastern themes just<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">53</a></span>
that homeliness of touch which endears them to
Western beholders. No better illustration could be
furnished than by the little silver-mounted <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">pot de
toilette</i> from Mr. Fitzhenry’s gift to the nation, figured
in <a href="#PLATE_13">Plate 13</a>. Little Japanese boys at play, houses
perched among fir-trees on rocky crags, tiny birds and
butterflies are scattered with an unimpeachable sense
of fitness over the creamy white surface; all, down to
the mark on the bottom, a <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">cour de chasse</i> in red enamel,
is drawn with the greatest neatness.</p>

<p>A ground colour of pure primrose-yellow is sometimes
seen in pieces of this early period, borrowed
doubtless from Meissen, and foreshadowing the
sumptuous coloured grounds of Vincennes and Sèvres.
This is well exemplified by a large jardinière with
rococo ormolu mounting, also in the Fitzhenry gift.
At a later date less distinctive manners were adopted,
bouquets of flowers of the Meissen type, cupids in the
style of Boucher, and rococo-panelled designs. The
manufacture was commercialised and the quality of
the wares rapidly deteriorated, but still a good word
may be said for the blue festooned borders which are
a common feature in Chantilly services, and are an
admirable pattern of what designs in table ware should
be. An instance is the service made for Louis
Philippe, duc d’Orléans, for use at his château of
Villers-Cotterets; a plate from this set is in the
Kensington collection.</p>

<div class="tb">* <span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>Two other minor factories of soft-paste china call
for a passing notice, those of <span class="smcap">Mennecy</span> and Sceaux,
both near Paris. The former appears to have been
first established in Paris itself, and in 1748 transferred
to a site at Mennecy on the estate of the duc de<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">54</a></span>
Villeroy, who supported it with his patronage. In
1773, on the expiration of their lease, the directors of
the works removed their plant to Bourg-la-Reine,
where they came under the protection of the comte
d’Eu. The factory was in the main confined to the
production of small articles for the boudoir, to which
their simple decoration of bouquets or brightly-plumaged
birds is well enough suited. Objects for
purely ornamental purposes are seldom met with.
In Mr. Fitzhenry’s gift there is a pair of vases on
high pedestals of the form known from its antique
prototype as the “<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">vase Médicis</i>,” finely painted with
birds in landscapes. It may be remarked that the
polychrome flower-painting of Mennecy often bears a
close resemblance to that of early Chelsea. Figures
were turned out in considerable quantities. The earlier
ones are generally left white, and show not only a sense
of the grotesque but also much artistic feeling in their
breadth of modelling. The later figures with polychrome
painting, somewhat childish conceptions, it is
true, are yet not without a certain grace and daintiness;
an important set of groups of children with musical
instruments in the Fitzhenry Collection belongs to this
class.</p>

<p>The works at <span class="smcap">Sceaux</span>, dating back apparently to
1749, are noteworthy for the skilfulness of their flower-paintings;
the tints are brilliant yet harmonious, while
the drawing is executed with remarkable care and sureness
of touch.</p>

<div class="tb">* <span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>The royal manufactory of <span class="smcap">Sèveres</span>, destined to
enjoy a fame greater than that of any other in Europe,
had its origin in a combination of circumstances from
which at first no great results might have been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">55</a></span>
expected. Orry de Fulvy, <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">intendant des finances</i> to
Louis XV., had long been interested in experiments
for making porcelain, when at Vincennes in 1738 he
came across two workmen from Chantilly, the brothers
Dubois, to whom reference has already been made.
They had been allowed secretly to set up a kiln in the
precincts of the château. De Fulvy gave them his
support, and their operations were continued at his
expense. The Dubois were subsequently dismissed as
incompetent, and the venture was in danger of abandonment;
but after many vicissitudes De Fulvy’s perseverance
was crowned with success, and in 1745 he was able
to form a company for the manufacture under royal
privilege. For eleven years the works were carried on
at Vincennes, but in 1756 they were transferred to new
premises at Sèvres, on the other side of Paris, at a
convenient distance from the royal palace of Versailles;
three years previously the company had been reorganised
under an exclusive privilege, the king himself
holding a quarter of the shares, while the royal
interest in the undertaking was signalised by the
stipulation that its productions should be marked with
the royal cipher of two interlaced “L”s.</p>

<p>From the outset the wares were given a high artistic
quality. Duplessis, goldsmith to the king, was charged
in 1747 with the control of the modellers; he kept the
workshops under close personal supervision, and to his
guiding influence is attributable the originality and unfailing
taste of the shapes adopted. Hellot, director of
the Academy of Sciences, was in charge of the chemical
composition of the materials, while Bachelier was at
the head of the painters and gilders. Drawings of
figure-subjects were supplied by François Boucher for
the painted decoration, as well as for translation into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">56</a></span>
the round by the modellers; an instance of the latter
process is the fine biscuit group of Leda modelled from
Boucher’s design by Fernex, a painted version of the
same subject being in the National Museum at
Stockholm.</p>

<p>The rare pieces surviving from the earliest stage
of the factory’s existence show clearly the aim which
De Fulvy set himself of competing with the Saxon
porcelain; the landscapes or river-scenes painted on
them, with miniature groups of figures and buildings,
are evidently inspired by the Meissen subjects of the
period. The same is true of the coloured grounds with
medallions in reserve which made their appearance
shortly afterwards, but the colours used for the purpose
were entirely new. The earliest of these was the deep
blue (“<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">gros bleu</i>”) from which was subsequently
developed the famous “<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">bleu de roi</i>.” The researches of
Hellot bore fruit later in the discovery of the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">rose
Pompadour</i> pink and turquoise-blue. A feature of the
earliest years of the factory before its removal from
Vincennes were the artificial flowers modelled in
porcelain, which amounted in value to over three-fourths

This manner of painting in a monochrome of blue or

back to an early style.</p>

<p>The <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">écuelle</i> or soup-bowl with cover and stand,

sumptuous style of Sèvres applied to the decoration of
porcelain for useful purposes. It bears the date-letter
“P” for 1768. The panels with pastoral scenes in
colours by Chabry fils follow closely the manner of
Boucher, if he did not actually supply the designs for
them; with the rich gilt scrollwork borders and the
turquoise ground they blend in an ensemble of splendid
but harmonious effect, admirably in keeping with the
gracefully-modelled shapes. Another specimen of Sèvres
table ware of a simpler class is the jug reproduced
in <a href="#PLATE_17">Plate 17</a>, with lid attached by a silver hinge. On

career came to a close. When compared with the

is to be seen, while the laurel-wreath round the foot
and the classical ornament surrounding the cameo-like
medallion betoken the adoption of the severer and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">58</a></span>
simpler style associated with the following reign. The
transition to antique forms and ornament came about
in Sèvres china more gradually than in other branches
of French applied art, partly on account of the fact
that in many cases the artists and workmen in the
factory were succeeded by their sons, who kept up the
traditions they had learned from their parents. The
change in the directorship and the succession of the new
king two years later finally determined the abandonment
of the old style.</p>

<p>The vase represented in <a href="#PLATE_19">Plate 19</a> is typical of the
new tendencies. It embodies to perfection the graceful
French interpretation of classical art associated with
the name of Louis XVI. The vase is noteworthy not only
as a splendid exponent of the powers of the royal manufacture,
but also on account of its historical associations.
It was made in 1780, and was given by Gustavus III.,
King of Sweden, as a present to the empress Catherine
II. of Russia; the gift was the outcome of an unexpected
turn of events, resulting from the war between
England and her American colonies. The state of
hostilities at sea was a grave menace to the commerce
of the northern countries, and an alliance was formed
on 1st August 1780, between Sweden, Denmark, and
Russia, powers at that time usually at variance, to
ensure the safety of their merchant fleets. Gustavus
III., who himself played the rôle of Augustus in Swedish
history, had a great admiration for the genius of the
Russian empress. He was at the time absent from his
kingdom on a long tour in the South, in the course of
which he had doubtless had opportunities of forming a
personal judgment of the merits of the French royal
porcelain. It is not surprising therefore that he should
have thought of a set of Sèvres china as a suitable
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">59</a></span>present to mark the occasion of the treaty; he invoked
to assist him in his choice a friend of earlier days, the
writer Marmontel, to whom he communicated his desires
through his ambassador at the French Court, the baron
de Staël. The circumstances of the purchase are fully
related in the letter dated 29th August 1780, by which
Marmontel informed the director of the factory, Regnier,
of the selection he had made at the works. Of five
pieces chosen to make up a <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">garniture de cheminée</i>, one is
the vase before us, and it is worth while to cite the
words in which it is described: “<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Un grand vase bleu
de roi et or, avec un cartouche représentant une marine
marchande. Dans ce petit tableau deux hommes sont
occupés à lire dans un livre posé sur un tonneau. Je suis
convenu avec le peintre que sur le livre il écrivoit ces mots
que je vais tracer figurativement</i>:</p>

<table summary="Engravement on vase">

</table>

<p><i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Il faut que ces caractères soient en émail et l’on m’a
promis que cette petite besogne seroit faite aujourd’hui.</i>”</p>

<p>The remaining four pieces of the set were a pair of
figures representing Pygmalion and Prometheus, and
two small cornucopia vases. Instructions were given
for the figures to be inscribed with verses of Marmontel’s
own composition, highly flattering to the imperial
recipient of the present. The letter concludes with a
request that the goods might be despatched without
delay to the Swedish king, who was awaiting them at
Spa. The price paid for the vase was 720 <i>livres</i>, and
for the complete set 1896 <i>livres</i>.</p>

<p>The subsequent story of the vase is not fully known,
but it may be surmised that it left Russia on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">60</a></span>
occasion of a great fire at the palace of Czarskoë Selo,
when it is recorded that many pieces now scattered
in various museums were stolen from the celebrated
turquoise-blue service of Sèvres china ordered by
Catherine II. in 1788. The vase was bought by Mr.
Jones in 1880 at the sale of the San Donato Palace at
Florence, and is now housed with the rest of his bequest
to the nation. It remains only to mention that the marine
subject in the style of Joseph Vernet is the work of
Morin, the bouquet of flowers in the reverse medallion
is by Fontaine, while the gilding was done by Le Guay,
whose signature with the royal cipher is painted under
the base.</p>

<p>A brief allusion has already been made to the
sculpture in biscuit china, which was among the most
remarkable work done at Sèvres during the time of its
prosperity. The enamelled figures in the Meissen style,
made in the earliest stages at Vincennes, were soon
superseded in popularity by those in biscuit, a much
better vehicle for reproducing delicate modelling. The
high artistic merit attained by them was due to the
guiding genius of the sculptor Falconet, who was in
charge of the modellers from 1757 for nearly ten years;
he himself provided the models for nearly all the figures
made during that period, the traditions set by him being
maintained by his successors. His nice sense of the
capabilities of his material is manifest alike in graceful
genre and pastoral subjects and in works of more
elevated conception, such as the Pygmalion group
already mentioned.</p>

<p>After the death of Bachelier the factory was
hampered by mismanagement and financial difficulties;
the consequent deterioration in its productions was
precipitated by the French Revolution, which marks
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">61</a></span>the close of its most glorious epoch. The artistic level
reached in the last years of Louis XV. was never again
attained until recent times; the success of the factory
was the outcome of the peculiar excellence of the Sèvres
soft-paste for the display of gilding and painting in
enamel colours, and the abandonment of this class of
body was inevitably followed by an artistic decline. At
quite an early stage of the factory’s career experiments
were made with a view to discovering in France the
materials for true hard porcelain like that of China and
Germany. The success of those researches in 1765 was
the prelude to the complete adoption of the new
material, when the works were rescued by Napoleon
from the state of adversity into which they had sunk in
the revolutionary period. For some years before the
fall of Louis XVI. both soft and hard-paste were made
concurrently; an early example of the latter is a cup
and saucer in the Jones Collection, painted with the
shield of France supported by an eagle and a dolphin,
made to commemorate the birth of the ill-fated Dauphin
in 1781. Under the Empire and the restored monarchy
everything was done that could be effected by rich
gilding and highly-finished painting to bring back the
magnificence of former years, and the new material
made possible dimensions never attempted before; witness
is borne by the huge vase in the Sèvres Museum
representing the arrival in Paris of the artistic spoils
of Napoleon’s Italian conquests, and another with a
frieze depicting the athletic sports of ancient Greece.
France suffered perhaps less than other countries
from the general debasement of art in that age, but
the redeeming charm of the eighteenth century styles
was gone, and with it the glory of the Sèvres factory;
its artistic recovery with the return of French prosperity<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">62</a></span>
under the Third Republic belongs to recent
history.</p>

<div class="tb">* <span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>Before leaving the subject of French porcelain,
something must be said of the cluster of <span class="smcap">Parisian
factories</span> for making hard-paste china, which arose in
many cases under Court patronage after the introduction
of the new material at Sèvres. The exclusive privileges
of the royal factory, designed to repress all attempts at
competition within the borders of France, had been one
by one abandoned, having become gradually of no effect.
In 1787 complete liberty was accorded to all French
manufacturers to pursue all the methods employed at
Sèvres, including the jealously-protected use of gilding.
As a rule only useful wares were made in the smaller
factories, but these were often of considerable merit.
The use of gold as the only decoration on a white
ground became increasingly popular, and much charming
ware is ornamented in this manner. A typical
instance may be cited in the spirit-kettle made at the
Clignancourt works, comprised in the series of Parisian
hard-paste in the Fitzhenry gift. The affectation by
these small factories of classical forms is exemplified
in the same collection by a ewer with oblong basin
decorated in gold and blue, made in the duc
d’Angoulême’s kilns in the rue Bondy, which are also
famous for the pretty cornflower-sprig pattern afterwards
popular in English china.</p>

<span class="subhead">GERMAN PORCELAIN</span></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">65</a></span>
While the efforts to imitate Chinese porcelain first
led to lasting results by the invention of soft-paste
porcelain in France, the credit belongs to Germany of
discovering and introducing into Europe the art of
making true hard-paste porcelain of the Chinese type.
The discovery was the outcome of researches not
originally directed to this end. The romantic story of
Johann Friedrich Böttger, the chemist to whom it was
due, is well known: how he claimed to possess the secret
of making gold, how he fled from Berlin across the
Saxon border to avoid the covetous attentions of the
King of Prussia, how he was promptly visited with the
fate he wished to escape, at the hands of Augustus the
Strong, Elector of Saxony and King of Poland, and how
he spent a great part of a short life in fruitless efforts
to make gold by alchemistic means for replenishing
the Elector’s coffers. It was only when the needs of
Augustus had become the more pressing, in consequence
of the exhausting war with Sweden through which he
lost the Polish Crown, that his optimistic credulity was
in danger of being overtaxed. Böttger foresaw that
the Elector could no longer be duped, and the happy idea
was suggested to him, probably by the chemist Von<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">66</a></span>
Tschirnhausen, of drawing a blind over his failure by
another plan for enriching his royal master. The latter
was foremost among the sovereigns of Europe as an
amateur of the porcelain at that time being imported by
Dutch merchants from the Far East; he was therefore
likely to view with favour Böttger’s new scheme, which
was no other than the restoration of Saxony’s prosperity
by the establishment in the country of ceramic industries,
and particularly of porcelain factories on the Chinese
lines. All Böttger’s efforts were now turned in this
direction. In 1708 a “<i xml:lang="de" lang="de">Steinbäckerei</i>” was started at
Dresden for the manufacture of tiles, and shortly after
Böttger’s celebrated red stoneware was invented. In
1710 he obtained a royal patent for the foundation of
a porcelain factory; the site chosen for it was the
fortress of Albrechtsburg, near <span class="smcap">Meissen</span>, and in the
course of the year the first samples were submitted to
the Elector, two small cups with enamel decoration,
still in the royal collection at Dresden. So began
the manufacture of hard-paste china in Europe.</p>

<p>The porcelain made at Meissen before Böttger’s death
derived its shape in part from contemporary metalwork
of the baroque style, and partly from the Elector’s
Chinese collection; statuettes were also modelled,
after the caricatures of the French etcher Callot.
Varied methods of decoration were attempted. Lace-like
borders inspired by French designs were executed
in enamel colours, or in gold, silver, or lustre; we also
find miniature hunting-scenes, such as are seen on
Bohemian and Silesian drinking-glasses of the period,
applied in gold leaf thickly laid on in slight relief.</p>

<p>After Böttger’s death in 1719 the painter Herold
became the leading spirit of the factory, and painting
began to play the chief rôle in the decoration of the wares.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">67</a></span>The earlier French borders gave place for a time to
faithful copies of Oriental patterns selected from the
royal collection, those of the Japanese Kakiyemon being
specially in favour. By 1730 a distinctive Meissen style
had arisen, characterised by simple baroque forms and a
decoration of panels enclosed with borders of delicate
symmetrical scrollwork in gold and colours, often
reserved on a monochrome ground; the panels are filled
either with groups of pseudo-Chinese figures, or with
landscape subjects depicting wide open country with
broad rivers, reminiscent of the lowland scenery to the
north of Dresden.</p>

<p>The appointment of the sculptor Johann Joachim
Kändler, in 1731, to be superintendent of the modellers,
led to a revolution in the character of the wares. If
painted figure-subjects were introduced, the favourite
themes were gallant parties of ladies and gentlemen in
the manner of Watteau, but relief ornament and not
painting now became the leading feature; the style
adopted in the modelling was a modified form of the
French rococo, and impressed itself on the productions
of most of the German factories which sprang up in
rivalry with Meissen. The very spirit of the German
rococo is embodied in the countless figures and groups,
destined among other purposes to form part of table-services
as decorative “<i xml:lang="de" lang="de">Tafelaufsätze</i>,” which were
modelled during this period by Kändler and his
associates; as we shall see later, they were extensively
copied in the earliest English china works. The development
of sculpture in porcelain inaugurated at Meissen is
a branch of the art in which Europe attained a proficiency
absolutely unknown in China; the German
factories in particular excelled in their skill in this class
of work.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">68</a></span>
The state of warfare in which Germany was
plunged about the middle of the century was a serious
check to the progress of the works. When peace was
restored in 1763, a new spirit began to manifest itself,
contemporaneously with the addition to the staff of the
French modeller Acier. The change was completed
under the directorship of Count Camillo Marcolini,
which lasted from 1774 to 1814. Just as in music, an
art in which Germany enjoyed at that time an unquestioned
supremacy, the sprightly melodies of Haydn
gave place to the graver harmonies of Beethoven, so in
porcelain too the altered mood of the age was reflected.
Florid rococo forms were abandoned and replaced by
the severer contours and simpler decoration of the
classic style of Louis XVI. The philosophic sentimentalism
of the day was not interested in the pretty
but aimless frivolities of the Watteau school, and
subjects of an entirely different order were chosen to
fill panels and medallions. A service at South Kensington
is painted with a series of careful miniatures in
illustration of Goethe’s <i>Sorrows of Werther</i>, a work in
which the spirit of the age is characteristically expressed.
Other favourite themes were Angelica Kauffmann’s
renderings of the more sentimental stories of classical
mythology.</p>

<p>The Meissen vase chosen for illustration in <a href="#PLATE_20">Plate 20</a>,
one of a set of three in the Jones Bequest, dates from
the earlier years of Count Marcolini’s management.
The slight decoration of dainty and pleasing effect
allows the fine qualities of the paste to be fully appreciated.
The various ornamental features embody in
characteristic manner the ideas of the age. The
symmetrical amphora form, the square architectural
plinth, the wreaths of oak on the cover and foot, point<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">69</a></span>
to the new interest awakened in ancient, more particularly
Roman, art by the publication of the antiquities
of Herculaneum; the garlands and festoons of forget-me-nots
recall the sentiment of an age that amused
itself with the study of the “language of flowers.”</p>

<div class="tb">* <span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>The Meissen factory had not long been working
before its success suggested the introduction of the
manufacture of porcelain in other German states, and in
less than fifty years from the date of the royal patent of
Augustus the Strong, a porcelain factory was considered
a necessary adjunct to the Court of even the minor
German rulers. The influence of Meissen is everywhere
apparent, but individuality shown in various directions
by a few of the rivals entitles them to special mention.
The seniority amongst these belongs to <span class="smcap">Vienna</span>, where
a factory was set up as early as 1718 by a Dutchman
with the help of workmen who had escaped from
Meissen; in 1744 it became an imperial institution.
The style of the wares followed closely on that of the
parent works, until financial embarrassments led to a
complete reorganisation under Baron von Sorgenthal in
1784. The change was heralded by the adoption of
severely angular shapes, and of romantic or mythological
subjects pictorially rendered, within elaborate borders
composed of classical motives carried out in rich highly-burnished
gilding on panels of gorgeous colouring; the
true qualities of porcelain were forgotten in the effort
to arrive at the highest pitch of sumptuous richness.</p>

<div class="tb">* <span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>The factory of <span class="smcap">Höchst</span>, under the patronage of the
Elector of Mainz, famous for its figures of children
modelled by Johann Peter Melchior, was also founded
with the help of a Meissen artist. Again, it was his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">70</a></span>
marriage with a Saxon princess that awakened in the
Elector of Bavaria, Max Josef III., the desire to
possess his own porcelain kilns. These were erected at
first at Neudeck, near Munich, and were removed in
1758 to <span class="smcap">Nymphenburg</span>. Thanks to an Italian sculptor,
Franz Bastelli, the Bavarian factory takes foremost
rank in Germany for its statuettes; whether characters
from the Italian comedy, or dancing cavaliers and ladies,
they display in their crisp, nervous lines, a spontaneity
tempered by masterly restraint which is best appreciated
when the white porcelain is left to speak for itself,
unobscured by the application of enamel colouring.</p>

<div class="tb">* <span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>The Duke of Württemberg’s factory at the
<i xml:lang="de" lang="de">Residenzstadt</i> of <span class="smcap">Ludwigsburg</span>, near Stuttgart, was
founded in 1758, a propitious moment for starting a
new enterprise of the kind, as Meissen and other
factories in northern Germany were suffering from the
effects of a long-protracted war. Under the directorship
of Ringler, who had previously gained experience
at Vienna and Neudeck, the works speedily reached a
high pitch of efficiency. In figures they were stamped
at an earlier date than other German works with the
new ideas of classicism, through the influence of the
sculptor who was appointed in 1759 to superintend the
modelling, Wilhelm Beyer of Gotha. As the result
of prolonged residence in Rome and Naples he was
deeply imbued with the spirit of antique sculpture.
He understood well how to temper the cold serenity of
the antique so as to suit the taste of an emotional age;
at the same time he knew how to modify classical forms
in compliance with the exigencies of his material, nor
did he, like later porcelain-modellers of the classical
school, renounce the charms of glaze and colour. The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">71</a></span>classical feeling makes itself felt as much in his pastoral
groups as in his renderings of mythological subjects.</p>

<p>Whilst Beyer was the pioneer of the classical in
porcelain figures, the Ludwigsburg factory was slow
to abandon the rococo style in its table wares. The
exceptionally graceful forms which they assume are
typified by the coffee-pot in Mr. Fitzhenry’s collection,
represented in <a href="#PLATE_21">Plate 21</a>. The gilt scrollwork under

<p>Excellent work was done in their best periods by
several other German factories. <span class="smcap">Berlin</span> under the
patronage of Frederick the Great was successful in
combining gracefulness of form with rich painted and
gilt decoration, as for instance in the beautiful rococo
service with openwork borders made for the Neue
Palais at Potsdam. The works of the Elector Palatine
at <span class="smcap">Frankenthal</span> rivalled Meissen in the rich diversity
of its figure-modelling, while at <span class="smcap">Ansbach</span> the factory
established by the Margrave Christian in 1758 excelled
in landscape work in the manner of Claude, painted <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">en
camaïeu</i> in crimson within elaborate gilt borders of
feathery rococo scrollwork.</p>

<p>The royal Danish factory at <span class="smcap">Copenhagen</span> may be
mentioned as another instance in which the help of
Meissen workmen was secured for setting the enterprise
on foot. The manufacture is represented at South
Kensington among other pieces by an important vase
with a portrait of the Crown Prince, afterwards
Frederick VI. of Denmark.</p>

The obscurity which enshrouds the history of the
earliest English porcelain works may be accounted for
by the fact that these factories were private ventures,
started for commercial purposes; they were not, as at
the outset were many of their Continental rivals, experimental
undertakings conducted under the protection,
or subsidised out of the funds, of a royal or princely
patron. It is true that the Chelsea works received
some measure of support from King George II. and
his son, the Duke of Cumberland, but it was probably
to private enterprise that they owed their beginning
and continuance alike.</p>

<p>While the earliest known piece of English china,
bearing the date 1745, belongs to Chelsea, the other
great London factory, Bow, has the honour of the
earliest documentary record of the manufacture in this
country. This priority, by one year only, based on a
patent applied for in 1744, entitles the Bow works to
be noticed first.</p>

<div class="tb">* <span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>Except in the direction of figures, the productions
of Bow were of an unambitious character. “Useful”
wares showing many varied types of decoration were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">76</a></span>
made during the thirty odd years of the factory’s
existence. The earlier of these were interpretations,
not as a rule slavish copies, of the Chinese <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">famille rose</i>
and of the works of the Japanese potter, Kakiyemon;
their colours are often harmonious, and their gilding
of peculiar richness. Such praise cannot be bestowed
on the later productions, which have too often a
garish and clumsy air; the charm of simplicity is
sacrificed in the effort to be splendid, and the results
are crude and ungainly. It is interesting to note some
pieces with landscapes so closely resembling the type
which is commonly found on the German porcelain
made at Fulda as to point to the suggestion that they
must have been derived from that source.</p>

<p>Some of the figures made at Bow show considerable
spirit and breadth of modelling, which is best appreciated
when the china has been left white, without the addition
of coloured enamels. The statuettes of the actors
Woodward and Kitty Clive in character, King Lear,
and some dignified figures of nuns, are almost as
effective as the white figures of Nymphenburg, of which
mention has already been made. These white pieces
date mostly from the earlier stages of the works. At a
later time the clever modelling is usually obscured by
enamelling of unpleasing tones. A great number of
the later figures are copied directly from the Meissen
models of Kändler. Instances in the Schreiber Collection
at Kensington are a spirited pair of prancing horses
held in respectively by a Turk and a negro, Augustus
the Strong of Saxony kissing his hand to a lady, and a
pair of tureens in the form of partridges on their
nests.</p>

<p>Perhaps the most pretentious figures ever made at
Bow were the pair of General Wolfe and the Marquis<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">77</a></span>
of Granby, of which there is an example in the same
collection. These were modelled by Tebo, who is
also mentioned as having worked at Worcester and
Bristol. The name has a curiously unfamiliar form,
and is probably an English phonetic spelling of the
French Thibaut. It is by no means improbable that he
was one of the many French potters who migrated to
this country in search of fortune, or to escape the
tyrannical pretensions of the French royal manufacture.
The pair of figures was doubtless made in 1760, to
commemorate the events of the previous year, so
glorious in the annals of British warfare. In the
victories of Quebec and Minden, Wolfe had met his
death and Lord Granby had won his first distinction by
saving the British cavalry from disgrace. These two
soldiers were the popular heroes of the day, and their
figures in porcelain would be sure to command a ready
sale. The portrait of Wolfe is copied from a sketch
by Captain Smith, which was engraved by Richard
Houston. Granby appears to be taken from a print
by the same engraver after a painting by Reynolds,
which was published in 1760; he is represented in the
uniform of Colonel of the Horse Guards.</p>

<div class="tb">* <span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>Passing on to <span class="smcap">Chelsea</span> we have to deal with
perhaps the most famous of English china works, one
that takes its place worthily beside the great factories
of the Continent. The history of Chelsea is in one
respect parallel to that of Bow; its earlier productions,
with all their technical imperfections, are possessed of a
charm that is wanting in the gorgeous and ambitious
achievements of its later years. This is notably the case
with the statuettes for which most of all the name of
Chelsea is famous. Neither the figures of the cream-<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">78</a></span>coloured
glassy paste marked with a triangle, nor those
in the heavy cold-looking material on which a raised
anchor often occurs, are devoid of spirit and vigour;
nor are these qualities concealed by the excessive use
of gold and enamel colours common at a later period.
While they are not for the most part original conceptions,
good judgment was exercised in the choice of
models to be copied. Barthélemy de Blémont’s <i>Nourrice</i>,
for example, is no less charming in white Chelsea
porcelain than in the colour-glazed earthenware in
which it first made its appearance.</p>

<p>After the works passed from the management of
Charles Gouyn into the hands of Nicholas Sprimont,
distinct changes are noticeable alike in the composition
of the paste and in the nature of the decoration, but
still for some time the colouring of the figures was
subdued and limited in range. New models appear,
copied in many cases directly from the Meissen figures
of Kändler and Acier; the masked man dancing with a
peasant girl, and the “Monkey Musicians,” may be
cited as instances. Chelsea seems, however, to have
been less dependent than Bow on extraneous inspiration.
During the last years of the factory’s independent
existence a great variety of fresh models make their
appearance, coming from the hand of sculptors such as
Roubiliac. Here at last original compositions are more
in evidence; where inspiration has been sought elsewhere
it has been derived not from porcelain prototypes, but
from painted works by French or English masters,
made accessible by contemporary engravings.</p>

<p>The masterpiece of Chelsea is the group of the
“Music Lesson,” with its two accompanying pairs of
figures symbolising the Four Seasons, made to form a
<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">garniture</i> for the chimney-piece; a complete set is in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">79</a></span>the Schreiber Collection, where it stands as a veritable
<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">tour de force</i> in porcelain. This set is the work of
Roubiliac, whose initial “R” is stamped on all three
pieces, the subject of the centre-piece being borrowed
from <i>L’Agréable Leçon</i> by Boucher. Other examples of
translation in the round from a painting or engraving
are the dancing figures taken from Watteau’s <i>Fêtes
vénétiennes</i>. Historical interest attaches to the pair
of figures of the democratic hero John Wilkes and
his champion, General Conway; they were doubtless
modelled in 1764, when Conway sprang into popularity
in consequence of the degradation with which he was
punished for having spoken in Parliament on Wilkes’s
behalf.</p>

<p>The later Chelsea figures of this class are usually so
much decorated that their attractiveness is gone, but
an example has been chosen for illustration in <a href="#PLATE_22">Plate 22</a>,
which has suffered less than others in this respect, and
is thoroughly characteristic of the style. The graceful
<i>allure</i> of the shepherdess with her basket of flowers and
kilted skirts will suffice as an excuse for the painter’s
extravagance in the decoration of her raiment.</p>

<p>In its earlier stages the Chelsea firm depended for
its vases and “useful” wares, as far as form was concerned,
on the models offered by Oriental china, and
by the work of contemporary London silversmiths.
In decoration also, Oriental, particularly Japanese,
patterns were closely followed. This lack of originality
is atoned for in some measure by the added charm
derived from the mellow surface of the soft Chelsea
glazes, while the very defects in the painting due to
the touch of a Western hand give a certain homeliness
which endears the imitations to an English amateur.
A beautiful example of this style is the hexagonal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">80</a></span>
covered vase in the Schreiber Collection depicted in
<a href="#PLATE_23">Plate 23</a>. Both shape and decoration are copied with
fidelity from an original of the school of the great
Japanese, Kakiyemon. The perfect balance of the
design and the harmony of the colouring are his, but
the interpretation and the material in which it is
embodied belong wholly to the Western potter;
“Western” must be said advisedly, for it must be
doubted whether English workmen had any but a
minor part at Chelsea in its early days. Whether the
“Japan patterns” were copied directly from Oriental
wares (the designs in a few instances are Chinese,
of the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">famille verte</i>), or whether they were obtained
through the medium of Meissen imitations of the
Oriental, it would be difficult to decide; the latter
would certainly be more easily obtainable in England.
It is, however, interesting to observe that the vase
here illustrated is an almost exact replica of a pair of
Japanese vases at Hampton Court Palace, belonging
to the collection formed probably by Queen Mary II.
through the agency of the Dutch East India merchants;
it is tempting to conjecture that the Chelsea artists
may have been allowed access to the royal apartments
for the purpose of making drawings for use at the
works.</p>

<p>Oriental patterns were gradually superseded by
motives inspired by rivalry with Saxon porcelain&mdash;sprays
of naturalistic flowers with insects, landscapes,
or animal subjects, such as the series in illustration of
Æsop’s Fables. A further advance is seen in the use
of ground colours betokening emulation of Sèvres,
which lasted in vogue till the independent existence of
Chelsea came to an end. The earliest of these colours,
an attempt at reproducing the French <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">bleu de roi</i>, is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">81</a></span>probably that occurring on the vases with a ground of
uneven streaky blue of rather dull tone which have
often been ascribed, without evidence to justify the
attribution, to the Longton Hall factory in Staffordshire.
Later a more satisfactory colour was arrived at in a
dense and splendid “mazarine blue,” while in the effort
to equal the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">rose Pompadour</i> of Sèvres, the claret-colour
was evolved of which the glory belongs to the Chelsea
works alone. On such splendid grounds as these were
reserved panels for miniature paintings taken, as the
contemporary sale catalogues inform us, from “Busha,”
“Burgam,” “Tenier,” and other foreign masters.</p>

<p>This style is exemplified by the sumptuous vases in
the Jones Bequest at South Kensington. One pair
with mazarine ground bears subjects from the set of
the “Four Seasons” painted by Boucher for Madame
de Pompadour in 1755. Other vases are painted with
a domestic scene in peasant life, and <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">La Cueillette de
Cerises</i> after the same artist. A pair of vases with a
claret-coloured ground have mountain landscapes with
cattle in the manner of Berghem. Wonderful as such
pieces are in the richness of their glaze and gilding and
in the careful finish of the paintings, the same defects
are generally observable as in the later Chelsea figures.
In the desire to cater for luxurious tastes, richness of
ornament has been carried to excess, nor do the
ungainly forms with their twisted rococo handles
compare in attractiveness with the modest shapes of
earlier times. The vase figuring in <a href="#PLATE_24">Plate 24</a>, the
middle one of a set of three in the Schreiber Collection,
suffers less than most from the defects of the period,
and well shows the richness of colour and gilding that
were then attained. The slightly uneven tone of the
deep blue ground was doubtless regarded by the makers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">82</a></span>
as a defect, which they would gladly have overcome if
they could; but it is just this quality of variety which
gives life to the surface, and makes these Chelsea
glazes compare favourably with the almost too perfect
ground colours of Sèvres.</p>

<p>The late Chelsea style is most pleasing in the wares
made for less pretentious purposes. No better illustration
could be found than the tea- and coffee-service with
claret-coloured ground bequeathed to the Victoria and
Albert Museum by Miss Emily Thomson of Dover.
The teapot is figured in <a href="#PLATE_25">Plate 25</a>. Every piece in
the service is differently painted with a figure in the
quaint dress which passed at the time for Oriental.
These charming miniatures are evidently inspired by
the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">chinoiseries</i> of Watteau, which reflected the growing
trade with the East under the auspices of the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Compagnie
des Indes</i>; a previous writer<a name="FNanchor_2" id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">2</a> has plausibly suggested
that this may be the actual “equipage most inimitably
enamelled in figures from the designs of Watteau”
which was offered for sale at the last auction of
Sprimont’s china held in Christie’s Sale-room in February
1770. The sumptuous decoration of such a
service need not be condemned when the surroundings
in which it was intended to take its place are borne in
mind; its display would greatly enhance the elegance
of a tea-party in an eighteenth-century drawing-room.</p>

<p>It seems, however, that Sprimont’s costly porcelain
was appreciated by too small a circle of patrons to
ensure its success as a commercial venture. After his
works had passed in 1770 into the hands of William
Duesbury of <span class="smcap">Derby</span>, the style to which most of all
Chelsea owes its renown was soon abandoned. In the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">83</a></span>china made during the ensuing period, in which
the Chelsea and Derby works were carried on conjointly
under the same proprietor, the Chelsea
element in the decoration is small, and it may be
inferred that the new manner which appears had
already been in vogue at Derby. At what date the
Derby factory was founded, and the nature of its
earliest productions, is obscure, but to it belongs the
credit for a style of decoration unsurpassed among
“useful” wares for its suitability to the purpose for
which the china was made. Many and varied are the
dainty borders, executed sometimes in gold alone,
sometimes in bright enamel colours laid on with a
sparing and discriminating hand. The scrollwork and
contorted forms of the rococo period entirely disappear,
to be revived only in imitative work of a later time,
when they had lost all vitality and meaning, and were
no longer in keeping with the spirit of the age.
Restraint verging at times on over-formality is the
keynote of the new era, in which for people of culture
in all parts of Europe the newly-found vases and
sculptures of ancient Greece and Rome were the
admired models.</p>

<p>The effect of the change was decidedly in favour of
porcelain as a material; the chastened decoration which
it brought with it allowed the charming qualities of
paste and glaze to be seen once more to full advantage,
and nowhere in European porcelain is the result more
happily shown than in the best work of Derby. The
ornamental vases of this period fell into the danger as
time went on of losing originality and liveliness, as
conformity with classical models became more rigorous,
but those dating from its earliest days offer a welcome
contrast to their Chelsea predecessors.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">84</a></span>
One of the finest forms made by Duesbury is
exemplified by the vase in the Jones Bequest shown
in <a href="#PLATE_26">Plate 26</a>. On either side of the body is an oval
medallion with a miniature painting. One of these
panels represents the incident of Celadon and Amelia
overtaken by the storm, from Thomson’s poem <i>The
Seasons</i>, the source of many a subject in the somewhat
theatrical figure-paintings of the time. On the reverse
side is a river-scene with a rider watering his horse in
the foreground, and a castle-keep on a hill in the
distance. The terminal female figures forming the
handles are in unglazed biscuit porcelain, offering a
pleasant contrast to the glancing surface of the body.
The gadroons on the neck, the frieze with a grotesque
mask between two lions, and the flowers in natural
colours on a gold groundwork, seem when analysed
rather incongruous elements, but the effect of the
whole though brilliant is yet harmonious. The <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">bleu de
roi</i>, which is the ground colour on the neck and foot,
is of a lighter tone than the Sèvres colour which it was
intended to imitate. It is possible that this vase may
be the actual one advertised in the sale-catalogue for
9th May 1773, as “<i>A most capital large therm vase</i>,
richly painted in compartments with figures of Celadon
and Armelia [<i>sic</i>], ornamented with fine blue and richly
finished with chased and burnished gold.”</p>

<p>The style of Derby porcelain was not greatly
modified while the works were in the hands of the
Duesbury family, but after they were leased in 1811 to
Robert Bloor a change came about. Little can be said
from an artistic point of view in praise of the output
of later years. Effective “Japan patterns” based on
Imari originals were adopted for tea- and dinner-services,
but generally over-decoration and vulgarity of form<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">85</a></span>
and colour were faults for which technical improvements
do not avail to compensate.</p>

<div class="tb">* <span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>The porcelain made during the eighteenth century
at the “<span class="smcap">Worcester</span> Tonquin Manufacture,” founded
by Dr. John Wall and others in 1751, has a more
English character than that of the other leading china
works in this country. Unambitious in its aims and
businesslike in its methods, it contented itself for a long
time with producing little but wares for useful purposes.
These are characterised by a certain homeliness in
the decoration and pleasing simplicity of form. The
thoroughly practical nature of the undertaking is borne
out by the somewhat doubtful distinction it enjoys of
being the pioneer in the use of printing for the decoration
of porcelain, or at all events the first factory to
make extensive use of this process. While in its early
days Worcester drew its inspiration from Oriental china,
the Eastern designs were taken rather as suggestions
for patterns than as models to be closely copied, as was
frequently the case at Chelsea. The same practice held
good even in later years, when after the engagement
of workmen from Chelsea in 1768, more pretentious
wares were attempted. The celebrated “scale-blue”
and “powder-blue” vases, with birds or flowers of
brilliant hues in reserved panels, were doubtless suggested
by the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">bleu de roi</i> of Sèvres, but they bear little
resemblance to their prototype, and, even in their most
splendid form they seldom err beyond the limits of
sobriety and good taste.</p>

<p>This character of the Worcester wares is well
illustrated by the little vase from the Schreiber
Collection chosen as the subject of the drawing reproduced
in <a href="#PLATE_27">Plate 27</a>. The pattern is a very free adaptation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">86</a></span>
of a Japanese design, in which the chrysanthemum and
the wattled fence motive, appearing here as a wheat-sheaf,
can be recognised; combined with this is a
turquoise border, edged with gilt rococo scrolls, betraying
some trace of French suggestion, but the whole is so
informally treated that no incongruity is felt, and the
general impression received is one of delightful freshness
and simplicity. The vase is typical of Worcester at
its best.</p>

<p>The change in management in 1783, when Thomas
Flight and his sons took over the control of the works,
did not at first bring with it a serious deterioration in
the quality of the china. A new decorative style was
adopted in compliance with the fashion of the day,
but the same quiet tastefulness was the keynote of the
decoration. The sober designs in dark blue and gold
almost equal those of Derby in their suitability for
the embellishment of table wares. It is not till the
beginning of the nineteenth century that a noticeable
decline sets in, but from that time forward the
Worcester wares, whether made in the original factory
or by the rival firm of Chamberlains, become increasingly
lacking in interest. All artistic qualities are smothered
in overloaded decoration, ungainly shapes, and unrestrained
lavishment of gilding.</p>

<div class="tb">* <span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>It was a Quaker apothecary of <span class="smcap">Plymouth</span>, William
Cookworthy by name, whose discovery of deposits of
kaolin and china clay in the neighbouring Duchy
enabled him in 1768 to obtain a patent for the first
English factory of true porcelain of the Chinese type.
The serious difficulties with which he had to contend
led to the removal of the establishment two years later
to <span class="smcap">Bristol</span>, where it was placed under the management
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">87</a></span>of Richard Champion. In 1773 the patent rights were
transferred entirely to the latter, and for eight years he
continued in the face of many discouragements to carry
on the manufacture; special interest attaches to it on
account of Champion’s personal relations with Edmund
Burke, at that time Member of Parliament for Bristol.
Forms and decoration were borrowed more from
Meissen and Sèvres than from Oriental types, nor were
they as a rule literal copies, but rather adaptations from
the originals. While the harmonious blending of the
enamels with the glaze, which is so pleasing a feature of
soft-paste china, was necessarily absent from the Bristol
productions, great brilliancy of colouring was obtained
without involving garishness of effect, as may be seen
from <a href="#PLATE_28">Plate 28</a>, drawn from a vase in the Schreiber
Collection. The fanciful birds are not original creations
of the Bristol painter, but reflect the type commonly
seen on early pieces of Vincennes and Sèvres; the quiet
dignity of the shape, on the other hand, is thoroughly
characteristic of the best English work.</p>

<div class="tb">* <span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>The minor English factories of the eighteenth
century, such as those of <span class="smcap">Longton Hall</span>, in Staffordshire,
<span class="smcap">Lowestoft</span>, and <span class="smcap">Caughley</span>, were either of too
short a duration to arrive at any high level of technical
attainment, or were devoted almost entirely to the
manufacture of commonplace wares for ordinary
domestic uses. The great extension of the porcelain
industry in this country, which signalised the opening
of the nineteenth century, was not productive of any
noteworthy results from an artistic point of view. At
the short-lived Welsh factories of <span class="smcap">Nantgarw</span> and
<span class="smcap">Swansea</span>, it is true, a glassy paste was invented which

<p>Punctuation, hyphenation, and spelling of English words were made consistent when a predominant
preference was found in this book; otherwise they were not changed.</p>

<p>The spelling and accent marks of non-English words have not been changed.</p>

<p>Simple typographical errors were corrected; ambiguous hyphens at
the ends of lines were retained.</p>

<p>Although the “List of Plates in Colour” on page <a href="#Page_xi">xi</a> is in numerical
sequence, the images themselves are not in sequence
in the original book; both sequences have been kept in this eBook.</p>

<p>The descriptions of some plates include illustrations of the marks
found on them, followed by the illustrations of the porcelain. In
the Plain Text version of this eBook, such plates are represented
by two “Illustration” tags, and the very first “Illustration” tag
represents the book’s cover.</p>

<p>In the original book, chapter headings occur twice: once as a
hemi-title and once just above the text of the chapter. In this
eBook, the second occurrences have been removed.</p>
